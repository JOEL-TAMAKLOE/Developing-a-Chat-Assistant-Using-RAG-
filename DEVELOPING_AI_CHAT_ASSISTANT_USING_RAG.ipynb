Bray\\nImagine being able to visit a disability claims office in a digital environment. \\nImagine a patent examiner equipped with digital assistants that could do the \\nbulk of administrative work behind processing patents. Artificial intelligence \\n(AI) may make both of these scenarios a reality. This chapter addresses the \\nquestion of how advances in and adoption of AI will transform public service \\nover the next twenty years. AI has dual meanings: \\n• artificial intelligence \\n• augmented intelligence, specifically how human capabilities can be \\nimproved by pairing them with machines to collectively work smarter \\nMost of the benefits to government will come from a people-centered \\napproach of pairing humans with machine learning to amplify human strengths \\nvia augmented intelligence. Such a people-centered approach means that the \\nsuccess of public service in the future depends on identifying beneficial ways \\nto augment the extant human abilities of networked, cross-sector teams—\\nwho want to improve the delivery of public service—with digital assistants \\nand learning machines to amplify the team’s strengths, mitigate any possible \\nblind spots, and increase the capabilities of the team as a whole. \\nThis chapter breaks down the possibilities into the near-term future \\n(2020-2025), the medium-term future (2025-2030), and the long-term \\nfuture (2030-2040), and then focuses on specific initiatives that are likely to \\nbe launched to employ AI to transform the public sector. \\nThe Near-Term Future (2020-2025)\\nThe near-term future includes using AI in specialized applications to \\nsupport the information and logistics functions traditionally performed by \\ngovernment to provide government services. It is important to note that \\nwhen deciding where to use AI, public servants determine to what degree \\nthe machines providing this assistance operate autonomously vs. semi-auton-\\nomously.\\n1 For the near future, most machines will probably provide support \\nthat still requires a human to act or make a decision. \\nFor all the near-term future possibilities discussed below, government \\nshould implement “public review boards” that look at the diversity, consis -\\ntency, and appropriateness of the data used. Without diverse or consistent \\ndata, the AI trained by the data may make decisions that erode public trust. \\nWithout appropriate use of data, public trust may also erode. For represen -\\ntative government, using “public review boards” in a form akin to a random \\njury selection process may be one way to ensure improved oversight. Such \\n222  '),\n",
              " Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/the future of AI.pdf', 'page': 2}, page_content=' The Future of Artificial Intelligence 223\\nactivities would also involve outreach efforts by public service organizations, \\nto increase digital literacy and the understanding of AI and what it can do. \\nFollowing are some examples of how AI will be deployed in the near future. \\nIncreased Use of AI-Supported Assistance for Individuals Seeking \\nGovernment Information. Several cities already have “311” telephone lines \\nand mobile apps to assist individuals with non-emergency city services as well \\nas to provide information on programs, events, and activities in the city. Such \\npublic-facing services will employ AI to help individuals with their questions. \\nHumans would still need to be in the loop for new questions where the AI \\ndoes not know the answer, or instances where the AI is uncertain about the \\nquestion being asked. Such AI assistance will also help government employ-\\nees with questions about onboarding, starting a new role, help with an exist-\\ning role, retiring, and other internal service queries. \\nIncreased Use of AI-Supported Assistance for Talent Management and \\nSkills Matching. AI will help community members find new jobs and tailor \\ntraining to hone and improve their skills for upward mobility in their jobs. \\nUnemployment and career assistance services will provide an AI assistant via \\nphone or at a physical career support center. The AI assistant will serve as a \\npersonal scout for new jobs based on questions answered by the individual \\nabout their skills, abilities, and desired work. The AI assistant will also help \\nwith tailored training opportunities accessible through in-person community \\ncolleges or online. Such AI assistance for talent management and skills match-\\ning will also be employed internally to government itself, to help the existing \\ngovernment workforce find new work opportunities and tailor individual train-\\ning to further develop skills and abilities. \\nIncreased Use of AI-Supported Review of Public Applications and \\nFilings. Current government functions often entail detailed forms and pro -\\ncesses to either prove or approve services to the public. Such functions \\ninclude licenses, land and jurisdictional approvals, individual claims, payment \\nprocessing, and travel-related documents. The current linear process of such \\napplications is outdated, usually requiring a human to identify the right form, \\nfill it out, and submit it—only to find that another form was needed or more \\ninformation was required. Instead, AI assistants will provide more tailored \\nsupport to individuals, to better understand what they are applying for and \\npre-review a public application or filing prior to human approval. \\nIncreased Use of AI-Supported Legal, Financial and Ethics Reviews. \\nLegal, financial, and ethics reviews often entail a rules-based approach of \\nreviewing information submitted to ensure it comports with specified require-\\nments. Such reviews fit well with how AI can assist humans. An AI assistant \\nwill do the initial review, let an individual know if more information is required, \\nand provide a preliminary result for final review by a human. \\nIncreased Use of AI-Supported Detection of Fake Images, Videos, and \\nAudio Files. It currently is possible to “clone” someone’s face to an image \\nor video of someone else’s body. Voices also can be “cloned” to produce \\naudio recordings that sound like someone saying something they did not say. '),\n",
              " Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/the future of AI.pdf', 'page': 3}, page_content='224 David A. Bray \\nDetecting such fake files requires detailed analysis and pattern matching, \\nlooking for inconsistences. An AI can support a human in detecting such \\nirregularities.\\nIncreased Use of AI-Supported Biometrics for Boarding Planes, \\nCrossing Borders. Machines are also good at identifying the biometrics that \\nmake one individual different from another. Within sufficient training, an AI \\napplication will identify a person based on their face—and possibly other \\nfactors, such as their fingerprints or the sound of their voice. Such biometrics \\nwould allow individuals to board planes and cross borders without having to \\ncarry a physical identification card.\\nA Brief History of Artificial Intelligence\\nIn 1943, a young academic by the name of Herbert A.

By 2025, engineers will probably have solved this \\nlimitation, making robots paired with AI a beneficial mechanism for the deliv-\\nery of materials to support public service. This will include using AI for civil \\nconstruction efforts, disaster response, healthcare, or other public functions. \\nUse of AI-Enabled “Tipping and Cueing” of Areas to Focus On. In a \\nworld in which more and more data is being produced by sensors connected \\nto the “internet of everything,” by 2025 AI will have advanced to the point \\nwhere it will be monitoring different data streams for patterns of interest—or \\nirregularities—that can then cue a human expert to look at something further. \\nThe human will then take an action that would further educate the AI for \\nadditional patterns to seek. This will include helping public service experts \\nmonitoring agricultural and health conditions in a geographic area. \\nUse of AI-Enabled Digital Assistants to Detect and Help Understand \\nBiases. We all have implicit biases. Each of us have biases that we accumu-\\nlate from our past experiences, including our early childhood. Some of these \\nbiases are discriminatory, such as an implicit preference for people who look \\nlike us or a favoritism to people who are taller and exhibit other physical \\ntraits. For public service, such implicit biases should not discourage a diverse \\nworkforce that seeks to serve the public. By 2025, AI will help hold up a \\n“digital mirror” to compare our decisions and other interactions with those of \\nothers. This can help each of us understand where our biases are and what \\nto do so that we may become less biased. Such an activity will also start to \\nprobe the boundary between the tacit, implicit knowledge a public service \\nexpert accumulates and the explicit knowledge they can articulate and share. \\nUse of AI-Enabled “Digital Twins” of Real-World Dynamics. Through \\nextending the data collected from the future “internet of everything,” by \\n2025 AI will allow public service organizations to build models of real-world \\ndynamics—either of actual physical assets or social interactions. Such mod-\\nels will create highly accurate “digital twins” that would allow individuals in \\npublic service to experiment with certain scenarios in a digital environment. \\nIndividuals will also do training for crisis response and other high-intensity \\nenvironments in a “digital twin” scenario, with AI providing recommendations \\non how to improve based on performance in the digital environment. \\nThe Long-Term Future (2030-2040)\\nIn 2030 and beyond, there are “farther out” ideas for the future of AI in \\npublic service.

At this point, we \\ncould imagine a future where “krewes” of humans augmented with machines \\nperform the work of public service, perhaps on a part-time basis if other pre-\\ndictions associated with the future of work also occur by 2030. \\nBy 2030, functions that used to be provided solely by government agen-\\ncies may now be provided either through a part-time workforce or a “Public \\nService Corps” willing to spend some hours a week on efforts assigned to \\nthem by a coordinating public service AI. This “Public Service Corps” would \\nembody what science-fiction author Bruce Sterling once dubbed a “krewe.”\\n11 \\nFor a krewe, the entity of importance is not an individual per se. Rather, \\nit is the combined abilities of a team of human individuals augmented with \\nintelligent assistants and relevant information streams to do the work they \\nneed to do. A diverse krewe brings many different perspectives to a scenario, \\nideally overcoming any specific individual biases. \\nIn such a futuristic scenario, several of the rote and repetitive functions \\ncurrently performed by government would be performed by AI in a semi-auto-\\nmated fashion such that applications associated with civil society activities \\nare pre-screened and feedback provided to human applicants prior to a final \\nhuman determination. Humans will still be involved for the more creative and \\nfinal decision roles. The need for clerical workers or administrative workers to \\nprocess applications will have gone down significantly. \\nIndividuals can work part-time because the machines will do much of the \\nwork in the background. In such a civil society, choosing to work in public \\nservice is seen as a true service. Individuals may be able to work in the pri -\\nvate sector in areas that AI assistants determine do not create conflict with \\ntheir public service assignments. For humans working with AIs in krewes, it \\nalso would be important to identify mechanisms to reward a whole-of-team \\noutcome and performance instead of solely individual actions. By working \\ntogether, humans and machines, the krewe would be collectively more intel-\\nligent and capable than any one individual alone. \\nAI can match humans into different ad-hoc teams or krewes to fit a spe-\\ncific public service goal or problem set. If an emergent event or crisis occurs, \\nAI can help identify who is available to assist with what activities—and even \\nhelp coordinate swarming activities of both humans and machines to assist \\nwith the response to the event. AI can learn which humans work better on \\nspecific tasks with other humans, and AI may even be able to identify which \\nrobots or parts of the AI hardware might be faulty or near-failing and thus \\nneed repair. \\nSuch a future would represent a major disruption to how government and \\npublic service currently function. This disruption would impact the workforce, \\npolicies, budgetary allocations, and administrative processes associated with \\ncurrent civil society functions. Such a future might impact military and intel-\\nligence functions in similar ways, with individuals who had already signed-up '),\n",

With strong support, both from the public and elected political \\nleaders, our representative government will be able to cross the chasm between \\nhow government currently operates and the ways in which public service could \\nbe dramatically transformed and deliver vastly better services and results to \\nthe public in 2040. \\nWhile this chapter presents potential milestones for where AI in public service \\ncould go, there will need to be experiments to gain expertise on the best way \\nto align policies, people, processes, and technology to achieve desired goals. \\nUnlike the venture capital community in the private sector, public service oper-\\nates with money from taxpayers who have a right to expect that their money is \\nspent wisely. This can create an environment in which maintaining the status \\nquo, instead of attempting to embrace AI, may slow or prevent a government \\nfrom achieving the benefits of AI. \\nThe public will also rightfully need to be informed about what AI and algorithms \\ndo and how they are being used. Transparency in these activities will be key \\nto engender public trust. Public discussions on what data should be used to \\ntrain and inform AI activities will need to occur. A workforce savvy enough to \\nkeep up with both the technologies associated with AI—and more importantly \\nthe civil, legal, and people-centered impacts of such technologies in public \\nservice—will need to be recruited and retained. \\nSafe spaces to learn and explore how AI can improve public service—and \\nthen to translate these activities into public service-wide scaled activities—will \\nneed to be put in place.\\n12 Without safe spaces and possibly high-priority goals, \\nanything that appears to have gone wrong or not worked on the first try may be \\npoliticized and prevent representative governments from being able to adapt to \\nthe rapidly accelerating age of AI.

Distrust in public service is \\nheightened and no one feels like they can help make a difference. While the \\nforeseen uses of AI discussed in this chapter seek to prevent such a scenario, \\nthe cautionary note that it could occur is worth remembering – if only to \\nemphasize why a more people-centered “better way forward” is needed for the \\nfuture of AI and public service ahead. \\nAs we embrace the future of AI in public service, we must recognize that AI \\ntechnologies will reflect the choices we humans make about how to use it, \\nwhom to include, and how to ensure the diversity, consistency, and appro -\\npriateness of AI’s activities within civil societies. Since we are human, not all \\ndecisions made initially will be perfect. However, with an environment that \\nencourages informed experimentation and appropriate safeguards to protect the \\npublic, we can course-correct and over time improve how civil society operates \\nfor the future ahead.

The dif ﬁculty in an introductory AI course lies in\\nconveying as many branches as possible without losing too much depth and\\nprecision.\\nRussell and Norvig ’s book [RN10] is more or less the standard introduction into\\nAI. However, since this book has 1,152 pages, and since it is too extensive and\\ncostly for most students, the requirements for writing this book were clear: it should\\nbe an accessible introduction to modern AI for self-study or as the foundation of a\\nfour-hour lecture, with at most 300 pages. The result is in front of you.\\nIn the space of 300 pages, a ﬁeld as extensive as AI cannot be fully covered. To\\navoid turning the book into a table of contents, I have attempted to go into some\\ndepth and to introduce concrete algorithms and applications in each of the following\\nbranches: agents, logic, search, reasoning with uncertainty, machine learning, and\\nneural networks.\\nThe ﬁelds of image processing, fuzzy logic, and natural language processing are\\nnot covered in detail. The ﬁeld of image processing, which is important for all of\\ncomputer science, is a stand-alone discipline with very good textbooks, such as\\n[GW08]. Natural language processing has a similar status. In recognizing and\\ngenerating text and spoken language, methods from logic, probabilistic reasoning,\\nand neural networks are applied. In this sense this ﬁeld is part of AI. On the other\\nhand, computer linguistics is its own extensive branch of computer science and has\\nmuch in common with formal languages. In this book we will point to such\\nappropriate systems in several places, but not give a systematic introduction. For a\\nﬁrst introduction in this ﬁeld, we refer to Chaps. 22 and 23 in [RN10]. Fuzzy logic,\\nor fuzzy set theory, has developed into a branch of control theory due to its primary\\napplication in automation technology and is covered in the corresponding books\\nand lectures. Therefore we will forego an introduction here.\\nThe dependencies between chapters of the book are coarsely sketched in the\\ngraph shown below.

For one thing there is our fascination\\nwith intelligence, which seemingly imparts to us humans a special place among life\\nforms. Questions arise such as “What is intelligence ?”, “How can one measure\\nintelligence?”or “How does the brain work ?”. All these questions are meaningful\\nwhen trying to understand arti ﬁcial intelligence. However, the central question for\\nthe engineer, especially for the computer scientist, is the question of the intelligent\\nmachine that behaves like a person, showing intelligent behavior.\\nThe attribute artiﬁcial might awaken much different associations. It brings up\\nfears of intelligent cyborgs. It recalls images from science ﬁction novels. It raises\\nthe question of whether our highest good, the soul, is something we should try to\\nunderstand, model, or even reconstruct.\\nWith such different offhand interpretations, it becomes dif ﬁcult to de ﬁne the term\\nartiﬁcial intelligence or AI simply and robustly. Nevertheless I would like to try,\\nusing examples and historical de ﬁnitions, to characterize the ﬁeld of AI. In 1955,\\nJohn McCarthy, one of the pioneers of AI, was the ﬁrst to de ﬁne the term artiﬁcial\\nintelligence, roughly as follows:\\nThe goal of AI is to develop machines that behave as though they were intelligent.\\nTo test this de ﬁnition, the reader might imagine the following scenario. Fifteen\\nor so small robotic vehicles are moving on an enclosed four by four meter square\\nsurface. One can observe various behavior patterns. Some vehicles form small\\ngroups with relatively little movement. Others move peacefully through the\\nspace and gracefully avoid any collision. Still others appear to follow a leader.\\nAggressive behaviors are also observable. Is what we are seeing intelligent\\nbehavior?\\nAccording to McCarthy ’sd e ﬁnition the aforementioned robots can be described\\nas intelligent. The psychologist Valentin Braitenberg has shown that this seemingly\\n© Springer International Publishing AG 2017\\nW.

              " Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Introduction to Artificial Intelligence ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'page': 16}, page_content='complex behavior can be produced by very simple electrical circuits [Bra84].\\nSo-called Braitenberg vehicles have two wheels, each of which is driven by an\\nindependent electric motor. The speed of each motor is in ﬂuenced by a light sensor\\non the front of the vehicle as shown in Fig. 1.1. The more light that hits the sensor,\\nthe faster the motor runs. Vehicle 1 in the left part of the ﬁgure, according to its\\nconﬁguration, moves away from a point light source. Vehicle 2 on the other hand\\nmoves toward the light source. Further small modi ﬁcations can create other\\nbehavior patterns, such that with these very simple vehicles we can realize the\\nimpressive behavior described above.\\nClearly the above de ﬁnition is insuf ﬁcient because AI has the goal of solving\\ndifﬁcult practical problems which are surely too demanding for the Braitenberg\\nvehicle. In the Encyclopedia Britannica [Bri91] one ﬁnds a Deﬁnition that goes like:\\nAI is the ability of digital computers or computer controlled robots to solve problems that\\nare normally associated with the higher intellectual processing capabilities of humans …\\nBut this de ﬁnition also has weaknesses. It would admit for example that a\\ncomputer with large memory that can save a long text and retrieve it on demand\\ndisplays intelligent capabilities, for memorization of long texts can certainly be\\nconsidered a higher intellectual processing capability of humans, as can for\\nexample the quick multiplication of two 20-digit numbers. According to this\\ndeﬁnition, then, every computer is an AI system. This dilemma is solved elegantly\\nby the following de ﬁnition by Elaine Rich [Ric83]:\\nArtiﬁcial Intelligence is the study of how to make computers do things at which, at the\\nmoment, people are better.\\nRich, tersely and concisely, characterizes what AI researchers have been doing for\\nthe last 50 years. Even in the year 2050, this de ﬁnition will be up to date.\\nTasks such as the execution of many computations in a short amount of time are\\nthe strong points of digital computers. In this regard they outperform humans by\\nmany multiples. In many other areas, however, humans are far superior to\\nmachines. For instance, a person entering an unfamiliar room will recognize the\\nsurroundings within fractions of a second and, if necessary, just as swiftly make\\ndecisions and plan actions. To date, this task is too demanding for autonomous\\n1\\nFig. 1.1 Two very simple Braitenberg vehicles and their reactions to a light source\\n1An autonomous robot works independently, without manual support, in particular without remote\\ncontrol.\\n2 1 Introduction'),\n",

According to Rich ’sd e ﬁnition, this is therefore a task for AI. In fact,\\nresearch on autonomous robots is an important, current theme in AI. Construction\\nof chess computers, on the other hand, has lost relevance because they already play\\nat or above the level of grandmasters.\\nIt would be dangerous, however, to conclude from Rich ’sd e ﬁnition that AI is\\nonly concerned with the pragmatic implementation of intelligent processes. Intel-\\nligent systems, in the sense of Rich ’sd e ﬁnition, cannot be built without a deep\\nunderstanding of human reasoning and intelligent action in general, because of\\nwhich neuroscience (see Sect. 1.1.1) is of great importance to AI. This also shows\\nthat the other cited de ﬁnitions re ﬂect important aspects of AI.\\nA particular strength of human intelligence is adaptivity. We are capable of\\nadjusting to various environmental conditions and change our behavior accordingly\\nthrough learning. Precisely because our learning ability is so vastly superior to that\\nof computers, machine learning is, according to Rich ’sd e ﬁnition, a central sub ﬁeld\\nof AI.\\n1.1.1 Brain Science and Problem Solving\\nThrough research of intelligent systems we can try to understand how the human\\nbrain works and then model or simulate it on the computer. Many ideas and\\nprinciples in the ﬁeld of neural networks (see Chap. 9) stem from brain science with\\nthe related ﬁeld of neuroscience.\\nA very different approach results from taking a goal-oriented line of action,\\nstarting from a problem and trying to ﬁnd the most optimal solution. How humans\\nsolve the problem is treated as unimportant here. The method, in this approach, is\\nsecondary. First and foremost is the optimal intelligent solution to the problem.\\nRather than employing a ﬁxed method (such as, for example, predicate logic) AI\\nhas as its constant goal the creation of intelligent agents for as many different tasks\\nas possible. Because the tasks may be very different, it is unsurprising that the\\nmethods currently employed in AI are often also quite different. Similar to medi-\\ncine, which encompasses many different, often life-saving diagnostic and therapy\\nprocedures, AI also offers a broad palette of effective solutions for widely varying\\napplications. For mental inspiration, consider Fig. 1.2 on page 4. Just as in medi-\\ncine, there is no universal method for all application areas of AI, rather a great\\nnumber of possible solutions for the great number of various everyday problems,\\nbig and small.\\nCognitive science is devoted to research into human thinking at a somewhat\\nhigher level. Similarly to brain science, this ﬁeld furnishes practical AI with many\\nimportant ideas. On the other hand, algorithms and implementations lead to further\\nimportant conclusions about how human reasoning functions. Thus these three\\nﬁelds bene ﬁt from a fruitful interdisciplinary exchange. The subject of this book,\\nhowever, is primarily problem-oriented AI as a subdiscipline of computer science.\\nThere are many interesting philosophical questions surrounding intelligence and\\nartiﬁcial intelligence. We humans have consciousness; that is, we can think about\\n1.1 What Is Artificial Intelligence? 3'),\n",

The mind-body problem in particu-\\nlar concerns whether or not the mind is bound to the body. We will not discuss\\nthese questions here. The interested reader may consult [Spe98, Spe97] and\\nis invited, in the course of AI technology studies, to form a personal opinion about\\nthese questions.\\n1.1.2 The Turing Test and Chatterbots\\nAlan Turing made a name for himself as an early pioneer of AI with his de ﬁnition\\nof an intelligent machine, in which the machine in question must pass the following\\ntest. The test person Alice sits in a locked room with two computer terminals. One\\nterminal is connected to a machine, the other with a non-malicious person Bob.\\nAlice can type questions into both terminals. She is given the task of deciding, after\\nﬁve minutes, which terminal belongs to the machine. The machine passes the test if\\nit can trick Alice at least 30% of the time [Tur50].\\nWhile the test is very interesting philosophically, for practical AI, which deals\\nwith problem solving, it is not a very relevant test. The reasons for this are similar to\\nthose mentioned above related to Braitenberg vehicles (see Exercise 1.3 on\\npage 21).\\nThe AI pioneer and social critic Joseph Weizenbaum developed a program\\nnamed Eliza, which is meant to answer a test subject ’s questions like a human\\npsychologist [Wei66]. He was in fact able to demonstrate success in many cases.\\nSupposedly his secretary often had long discussions with the program. Today in the\\ninternet there are many so-called chatterbots, some of whose initial responses are\\nquite impressive. After a certain amount of time, however, their arti ﬁcial nature\\nbecomes apparent. Some of these programs are actually capable of learning, while\\nothers possess extraordinary knowledge of various subjects, for example geography\\nor software development. There are already commercial applications for chatterbots\\nin online customer support and there may be others in the ﬁeld of e-learning. It is\\nconceivable that the learner and the e-learning system could communicate through a\\nchatterbot. The reader may wish to compare several chatterbots and evaluate their\\nintelligence in Exercise 1.1 on page 20.\\n1.2 The History of AI\\nAI draws upon many past scienti ﬁc achievements which are not mentioned here, for\\nAI as a science in its own right has only existed since the middle of the Twentieth\\nCentury.

Of particular interest for AI are G ödel’s\\ntheorems. The completeness theorem states that ﬁrst-order predicate logic is com-\\nplete. This means that every true statement that can be formulated in predicate logic is\\nprovable using the rules of a formal calculus. On this basis, automatic theorem provers\\ncould later be constructed as implementations of formal calculi. With the incom-\\npleteness theorem, Gö del showed that in higher-order logics there exist true state-\\nments that are unprovable.\\n2 With this he uncovered painful limits of formal systems.\\nAlan Turing ’s proof of the undecidability of the halting problem also falls into\\nthis time period. He showed that there is no program that can decide whether a\\ngiven arbitrary program (and its respective input) will run in an in ﬁnite loop.

The reason for this was the string of impressive achievements in\\nsymbol processing. With the Fifth Generation Computer Systems project in Japan\\nand the ESPRIT program in Europe, heavy investment went into the construction of\\nintelligent computers.\\nFor small problems, automatic provers and other symbol-processing systems\\nsometimes worked very well. The combinatorial explosion of the search space,\\nhowever, de ﬁned a very narrow window for these successes. This phase of AI was\\ndescribed in [RN10] as the “Look, Ma, no hands! ”era.\\nBecause the economic success of AI systems fell short of expectations, funding\\nfor logic-based AI research in the United States fell dramatically during the 1980s.\\n1.2.3 The New Connectionism\\nDuring this phase of disillusionment, computer scientists, physicists, and Cognitive\\nscientists were able to show, using computers which were now suf ﬁciently pow-\\nerful, that mathematically modeled neural networks are capable of learning using\\ntraining examples, to perform tasks which previously required costly programming.\\nBecause of the fault-tolerance of such systems and their ability to recognize pat-\\nterns, considerable successes became possible, especially in pattern recognition.\\nFacial recognition in photos and handwriting recognition are two example appli-\\ncations. The system Nettalk was able to learn speech from example texts [SR86].\\nUnder the name connectionism, a new subdiscipline of AI was born.\\nConnectionism boomed and the subsidies ﬂowed. But soon even here feasibility\\nlimits became obvious. The neural networks could acquire impressive capabilities,\\nbut it was usually not possible to capture the learned concept in simple formulas or\\nlogical rules. Attempts to combine neural nets with logical rules or the knowledge\\nof human experts met with great dif ﬁculties. Additionally, no satisfactory solution\\nto the structuring and modularization of the networks was found.\\n1.2.4 Reasoning Under Uncertainty\\nAI as a practical, goal-driven science searched for a way out of this crisis. One\\nwished to unite logic ’s ability to explicitly represent knowledge with neural net-\\nworks’strength in handling uncertainty. Several alternatives were suggested.\\nThe most promising, probabilistic reasoning , works with conditional probabil-\\nities for propositional calculus formulas.

The success of Bayesian networks stems from their intuitive compre-\\nhensibility, the clean semantics of conditional probability, and from the\\ncenturies-old, mathematically grounded probability theory.\\nThe weaknesses of logic, which can only work with two truth values, can be\\nsolved by fuzzy logic , which pragmatically introduces in ﬁnitely many values\\nbetween zero and one. Though even today its theoretical foundation is not totally\\nﬁrm, it is being successfully utilized, especially in control engineering.\\nA much different path led to the successful synthesis of logic and neural net-\\nworks under the name hybrid systems . For example, neural networks were\\nemployed to learn heuristics for reduction of the huge combinatorial search space in\\nproof discovery [SE90].\\nMethods of decision tree learning from data also work with probabilities.\\nSystems like CART, ID3 and C4.5 can quickly and automatically build very\\naccurate decision trees which can represent propositional logic concepts and then\\nbe used as expert systems. Today they are a favorite among machine learning\\ntechniques (Sect. 8.4).\\nSince about 1990, data mining has developed as a subdiscipline of AI in the area\\nof statistical data analysis for extraction of knowledge from large databases. Data\\nmining brings no new techniques to AI, rather it introduces the requirement of using\\nlarge databases to gain explicit knowledge. One application with great market\\npotential is steering ad campaigns of big businesses based on analysis of many\\nmillions of purchases by their customers. Typically, machine learning techniques\\nsuch as decision tree learning come into play here.\\n1.2.5 Distributed, Autonomous and Learning Agents\\nDistributed arti ﬁcial intelligence, DAI, has been an active area research since about\\n1985. One of its goals is the use of parallel computers to increase the ef ﬁciency of\\nproblem solvers. It turned out, however, that because of the high computational\\ncomplexity of most problems, the use of “intelligent” systems is more bene ﬁcial\\nthan parallelization itself.\\nA very different conceptual approach results from the development of autonomous\\nsoftware agents and robots that are meant to cooperate like human teams. As with the\\naforementioned Braitenberg vehicles, there are many cases in which an individual\\nagent is not capable of solving a problem, even with unlimited resources. Only the\\ncooperation of many agents leads to the intelligent behavior or to the solution of a\\nproblem. An ant colony or a termite colony is capable of erecting buildings of very\\nhigh architectural complexity, despite the fact that no single ant comprehends how the\\nwhole thing ﬁts together. This is similar to the situation of provisioning bread for a\\nlarge city like New York [RN10].

To successfully develop an AI project is therefore not always so\\nsimple, but almost always extremely exciting.\\n1.2.7 The AI Revolution\\nAround the year 2010 after about 25 years of research on neural networks, scientists\\ncould start harvesting the fruits of their research. The very powerful deep learning\\nnetworks can for example learn to classify images with very high arruracy.

Thus we are increasingly confronted with AI in everyday life. The reader,\\nwho may soon be working as an AI developer, must also deal with the social impact\\nof this work. As an author of a book on AI techniques, I have the crucial task of\\nexamining this topic. I would like to deal with some particularly important aspects\\nof AI which are of great practical relevance for our lives.\\n1.3.1 Does AI Destroy Jobs?\\nIn January 2016, the World Econonic Forum published a study [SS16], frequently\\ncited by the German press, predicting that “industry 4.0 ”would destroy over ﬁve\\n1.2 The History of AI 11'),\n",
              " Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Introduction to Artificial Intelligence ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'page': 26}, page_content='million jobs in the next ﬁve years. This forecast is hardly surprising because auto-\\nmation in factories, of ﬁces, administration, transportation, in the home and in many\\nother areas has led to continually more work being done by computers, machines and\\nrobots. AI has been one of the most important factors in this trend since about 2010.\\nPresumably, the majority of people would gladly leave physically hard, dirty and\\nunhealthy jobs and tasks to machines. Thus automation is a complete blessing for\\nhumanity, assuming it does not result in negative side effects, such as harm to the\\nenvironment. Many of the aforementioned unpleasant jobs can be done faster, more\\nprecisely, and above all cheaper by machines. This seems almost like a trend\\ntowards paradise on Earth, where human beings do less and less unpleasant work\\nand have correspondingly more time for the good things in life. This seems almost\\nlike a trend towards paradise on earth. We have to do less and less unpleasant work\\nand in turn have more time for the good things in life.\\n4 All the while, we would\\nenjoy the same (or potentially even increasing) prosperity, for the economy would\\nnot employ these machines if they did not markedly raise productivity.\\nUnfortunately we are not on the road to paradise. For several decades, we have\\nworked more than 40 hours per week, have been stressed, complained of burnout\\nand other sicknesses, and suffered a decline in real wages. How can this be, if\\nproductivity is continually increasing? Many economists say that the reason for this\\nis competitive pressure. In an effort to compete and deliver the lowest priced goods\\nto market, companies need to lower production costs and thus lay off workers. This\\nresults in the aforementioned unemployment. In order to avoid a drop in sales\\nvolume due to reduced prices, more products need to be manufactured and sold.\\nThe economy must grow!\\nIf the economy continues to grow in a country in which the population is no\\nlonger growing (as is the case in most modern industrialized countries), each citizen\\nmust necessarily consume more. For that to happen, new markets must be created,\\n5\\nand marketing has the task of convincing us that we want the new products.\\nThis is — allegedly— the only way to “sustainably” ensure prosperity. Apparently\\nthere seems to be no escape from this growth/consumption spiral. This has two fatal\\nconsequences. For one thing, this increase in consumption should make people\\nhappier, but it is having quite the opposite effect: mental illness is increasing.\\nEven more obvious and, above all, fatal, are economic growth ’s effects on our\\nliving conditions. It is no secret that the earth ’s growth limit has long been excee-\\nded [MMZM72, Ran12], and that we are overexploiting nature ’s nonrenewable\\nresources. We are therefore living at the expense of our children and grandchildren,\\nwho consequently will have poorer living conditions than we have today.

Thus it is obvious that we should abandon this path of growth for the sake\\nof a livable future. But how?\\nLet’s think back to the road to paradise that AI is supposedly preparing for us.\\nApparently, as we practice it, it does not lead to paradise. Understanding this\\nproblem and ﬁnding the right path is one of the central tasks of today. Because of\\ninherent complexities, this problem can not be fully dealt with in an introductory AI\\ntextbook. However, I would like to provide the reader with a little food for thought.\\nAlthough productivity is growing steadily in almost all areas of the economy,\\nworkers are required to work as hard as ever. They do not bene ﬁt from the increase\\nin productivity. So, we must ask, where do the pro ﬁts go? Evidently not to the\\npeople to whom they are owed, i.e. the workers. Instead, part of the pro ﬁts is spent\\non investment and thus on further growth and the rest is taken by the capital\\nowners, while employees work the same hours for declining real wages [Pik14].\\nThis leads to ever-increasing capital concentration among a few rich individuals and\\nprivate banks, while on the other hand increasing poverty around the world is\\ncreating political tensions that result in war, expulsion and ﬂight.\\nWhat is missing is a fair and just distribution of pro ﬁts. How can this be\\nachieved? Politicians and economists are continually trying to optimize our eco-\\nnomic system, but politics has not offered a sustainable solution, and too few\\neconomists are investigating this highly exciting economic question. Obviously the\\nattempt to optimize the parameters of our current capitalist economic system has not\\nlead to a more equitable distribution of wealth, but to the opposite.\\nThis is why economists and ﬁnancial scientists must begin to question the\\nsystem and look for alternatives. We should ask ourselves how to change the rules\\nand laws of the economy so that all people pro ﬁt from increased productivity.\\nA growing community of economists and sustainability scientists have offered\\ninteresting solutions, a few of which I will brie ﬂy describe here.\\nProblem Number One is the creation of ﬁat money by the banks. New money —\\nwhich is needed, among other things, to keep our growing economy going — is now\\nbeing created by private banks. This is made possible by the fact that banks have to\\nown only a small part, namely the minimum cash reserve ratio, of the money they\\ngive as loans. In the EU in 2016, the minimum cash reserve ratio is one percent.\\nStates then borrow this money from private banks in the form of government\\nbonds and thus fall into debt. This is how our current government debt crises have\\ndeveloped. This problem can be solved easily by prohibiting creation of money by\\nthe banks by increasing the minimum cash reserve ratio to 100%. State central banks\\nwill then get back the monopoly on creating money, and the newly created money\\ncan be used directly by the state for the purposes of social welfare. It should be\\nevident that this simple measure would signi ﬁcantly ease the problem of public debt.\\nFurther interesting components of such an economic reform could be the\\nconversion of the current interest rate system to the so-called natural economic order\\n[GP58], and the introduction of the “economy for the common good ”[Fel14] and the\\nbiophysical economy [GK09, Küm11]. The practical implementation of the econ-\\nomy for the common good would involve a tax reform, the most important elements\\nof which would be the abolition of the income tax and substantially increased value\\n1.3 AI and Society 13'),\n",

We would thus arrive at a highly\\nprosperous, more sustainable human world with less environmental damage and\\nmore local trade. The reader may study the literature and assess whether the ideas\\nquoted here are interesting and, if necessary, help to make the required changes.\\nTo conclude this section, I would like to quote the famous physicist Stephen\\nHawking. In a community-driven interview on www.reddit.comhe gave the following\\nanswer to whether he had any thoughts about unemployment caused by automation:\\nIf machines produce everything we need, the outcome will depend on how things are\\ndistributed. Everyone can enjoy a life of luxurious leisure if the machine-produced\\nwealth is shared, or most people can end up miserably poor if the machine-owners\\nsuccessfully lobby against wealth redistribution. So far, the trend seems to be toward the\\nsecond option, with technology driving ever-increasing inequality.\\nAnother Hawking quotation is also ﬁtting. During the same interview, 6 to an AI\\nprofessor’s question about which moral ideas he should impart to his students,\\nHawking answered:\\n… Please encourage your students to think not only about how to create AI, but also about\\nhow to ensure its bene ﬁcial use.\\nAs a consequence we should question the reasonableness of AI applications such as\\nthe export of intelligent cruise missiles to “allied”Arab states, the deployment of\\nhumanoid combat robots, etc.\\n1.3.2 AI and Transportation\\nIn the past 130 years, automotive industry engineers have made great strides. In\\nGermany, one out of every two people owns their own car. These cars are highly\\nreliable. This makes us very mobile and we use this very convenient mobility in work,\\neveryday life and leisure. Moreover, we are dependent on it. Today, we can not get by\\nwithout a motor vehicle, especially in rural areas with weak public transportation\\ninfrastructure, as for instance in Upper Swabia, where the author and his students live.\\nThe next stage of increased convenience in road transportation is now imminent.\\nIn a few years, we will be able to buy electric self-driving cars, i.e. robotic cars,\\nwhich will autonomously bring us to almost any destination. All passengers in the\\nrobotic car would be able to read, work or sleep during the trip. This is possible on\\npublic transit already, but passengers in a robotic car would be able to do this at any\\ntime and on any route.\\nAutonomous vehicles that can operate independently could also travel without\\npassengers. This will lead to yet another increase in convenience: robotic taxis. Via a\\nsmartphone app, we will be able to order the optimal taxi, in terms of size and\\nequipment, for any conceivable transportation purpose.

All associated responsibil-\\nities and expenses, such as refueling, technical service, cleaning, searching for parking,\\nbuying and selling, garage rent, etc. are void, which saves us money and effort.\\nBesides the immediate gains in comfort and convenience, robotic cars will offer\\nother signiﬁcant advantages. For example, according to a McKinsey study [GHZ14],\\nwe will need far fewer cars and, above all, far fewer parking places in the era of\\nself-driving cars, which will lead to an immense reduction in resource consumption.\\nAccording to a Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory study [GS15], electric\\nself-driving cars will cause a 90% reduction in green house emissions per passenger\\nmile due to the vehicles ’energy efﬁciency and the optimized ﬁt between the vehicle\\nand its purpose. Due to their optimal resource utilization, robotic taxis will be much\\nmore environmentally friendly than, for example, heavy buses, which often run at\\nlow capacity, especially in rural areas. Overall, robot taxis will contribute dramati-\\ncally to energy savings and thus, among other things, to a signi ﬁcant improvement in\\nCO\\n2 and climate problems.\\nPassenger safety will be much higher than it is today. Experts currently estimate\\nfuture accident rates between zero and ten percent compared to today. Emotional\\ndriving ( “road rage ”), distracted driving and driving under the in ﬂuence of drugs\\nand alcohol will no longer exist.\\nTaxi drivers losing their jobs is often cited as a disadvantage of robotic cars. It is\\nalmost certain that there will no longer be taxi drivers from about 2030 onwards,\\nbut that is not necessarily a problem. As explained in the previous section, our\\nsociety just needs to deal with the newly gained productivity properly.\\nIn addition to the many advantages mentioned above, robotic cars have two critical\\nproblems. Firstly, the so-called rebound effect will nullify at least some of the gains in\\nresource, energy and time savings. Shorter driving times as well as more comfortable\\nand cheaper driving will tempt us to drive more. We can only deal with this problem\\nby rethinking our attitude towards consumption and quality of life. Do we have to use\\nthe entire time saved for more activities? Here we are all invited to critical re ﬂection.\\nAnother problem we should take seriously is that the robotic cars will need to be\\nnetworked. In principle, this gives hackers and terrorists the ability to access and\\nmanipulate the vehicles ’controls through security holes in their network protocols.\\nIf a hacker manages to do this once, he could repeat the attack on a grand scale,\\npotentially bringing entire vehicle ﬂeets to a halt, causing accidents, spying on\\nvehicle occupants, or initiating other criminal actions. Here, as in other areas such\\nas home automation and the Internet of Things, IT security experts will be needed\\nto ensure the highest possible security guarantees using tools of the trade such as\\ncryptographic methods. By the way, improved machine learning algorithms will be\\nuseful in detecting hacking attacks.\\n1.3.3 Service Robotics\\nIn a few years, shortly after self-driving cars, the next bit of consumption bait on the\\nshelves of electronics stores will be service robots.

Agent denotes rather generally a\\nsystem that processes information and produces an output from an input. These\\nagents may be classi ﬁed in many different ways.\\nIn classical computer science, software agents are primarily employed\\n(Fig. 1.5). In this case the agent consists of a program that calculates a result from\\nuser input.\\nIn robotics, on the other hand, hardware agents (also called autonomous robots)\\nare employed, which additionally have sensors and actuators at their disposal\\n(Fig. 1.6). The agent can perceive its environment with the sensors. With the\\nactuators it carries out actions and changes its environment.\\nWith respect to the intelligence of the agent, there is a distinction between reﬂex\\nagents, which only react to input, and agents with memory , which can also include\\nthe past in their decisions. For example, a driving robot that through its sensors\\nknows its exact position (and the time) has no way, as a re ﬂex agent, of determining\\nits velocity. If, however, it saves the position, at short, discrete time steps, it can\\nthus easily calculate its average velocity in the previous time interval.\\nIf a re ﬂex agent is controlled by a deterministic program, it represents a function\\nof the set of all inputs to the set of all outputs. An agent with memory, on the other\\nhand, is in general not a function. Why? (See Exercise 1.5 on page 21.) Re ﬂex\\nagents are suf ﬁcient in cases where the problem to be solved involves a Markov\\ndecision process. This is a process in which only the current state is needed to\\ndetermine the optimal next action (see Chap. 10).\\nA mobile robot which should move from room 112 to room 179 in a building\\ntakes actions different from those of a robot that should move to room 105. In other\\nwords, the actions depend on the goal. Such agents are called goal-based.\\nFig. 1.5 A software agent\\nwith user interaction\\nFig. 1.6 A hardware agent\\n1.4 Agents 17'),\n",

Its goal as a goal-\\nbased agent is to put all emails in the right category. In the course of this\\nnot-so-simple task, the agent can occasionally make mistakes. Because its goal is to\\nclassify all emails correctly, it will attempt to make as few errors as possible.\\nHowever, that is not always what the user has in mind. Let us compare the fol-\\nlowing two agents. Out of 1,000 emails, Agent 1 makes only 12 errors. Agent 2 on\\nthe other hand makes 38 errors with the same 1,000 emails. Is it therefore worse\\nthan Agent 1?

Because there are in this\\ncase two types of errors of differing severity, each error should be weighted with the\\nappropriate cost factor (see Sect. 7.3.5 and Exercise 1.7 on page 21).\\nThe sum of all weighted errors gives the total cost caused by erroneous\\ndecisions.The goal of a cost-based agent is to minimize the cost of erroneous\\ndecisions in the long term, that is, on average. In Sect. 7.3 we will become\\nfamiliar with the medical diagnosis system LEXMED as an example of a\\ncost-based agent.\\nAnalogously, the goal of a utility-based agent is to maximize the utility derived\\nfrom correct decisions in the long term, that is, on average. The sum of all decisions\\nweighted by their respective utility factors gives the total utility.\\nOf particular interest in AI are Learning agents , which are capable of changing\\nthemselves given training examples or through positive or negative feedback, such\\nthat the average utility of their actions grows over time (see Chap. 8).\\nAs mentioned in Sect. 1.2.5, distributed agents are increasingly coming into use,\\nwhose intelligence are not localized in one agent, but rather can only be seen\\nthrough cooperation of many agents.\\nThe design of an agent is oriented, along with its objective, strongly toward its\\nenvironment, or alternately its picture of the environment, which strongly depends\\non it sensors.

This system is called the inference mechanism . The knowledge is stored in\\na knowledge base (KB). Acquisition of knowledge in the knowledge base is\\ndenoted Knowledge Engineering and is based on various knowledge sources such\\nas human experts, the knowledge engineer, and databases. Active learning\\nsystems can also acquire knowledge through active exploration of the world (see\\nChap. 10). In Fig. 1.7 the general architecture of knowledge-based systems is\\npresented.\\nMoving toward a separation of knowledge and inference has several crucial\\nadvantages. The separation of knowledge and inference can allow inference\\nsystems to be implemented in a largely application-independent way. For example,\\napplication of a medical expert system to other diseases is much easier by replacing\\nthe knowledge base rather than by programming a whole new system.\\nThrough the decoupling of the knowledge base from inference, knowledge can\\nbe stored declaratively. In the knowledge base there is only a description of the\\nknowledge, which is independent from the inference system in use. Without this\\nclear separation, knowledge and processing of inference steps would be interwoven,\\nand any changes to the knowledge would be very costly.\\nFig. 1.7 Structure of a classic knowledge-processing system\\n1.5 Knowledge-Based Systems 19'),\n",

Following Theorem 2.3 on page 28 we must show that a\\ncontradiction can be derived from KB ^ ¬Q. In formulas in conjunctive normal\\nform, a contradiction appears in the form of two clauses ( A) and ( ¬A), which lead to\\nthe empty clause as their resolvent. The following theorem ensures us that this\\nprocess really works as desired.\\nFor the calculus to be complete, we need a small addition, as shown by the\\nfollowing example. Let the formula ( A _ A) be given as our knowledge base.

In contrast to other calculi,\\nresolution has only two inference rules, and it works with formulas in conjunctive\\nnormal form. This makes its implementation simpler. A further advantage com-\\npared to many calculi lies in its reduction in the number of possibilities for the\\napplication of inference rules in every step of the proof, whereby the search space is\\nreduced and computation time decreased.\\nAs an example, we start with a simple logic puzzle that allows the important\\nsteps of a resolution proof to be shown.\\n2.4 Resolution 31'),\n",

Thus the sets of unsatis ﬁable, satis ﬁable, and valid formulas are\\ndecidable. The computation time of the truth table method for satis ﬁability grows in\\nthe worst case exponentially with the number n of variables because the truth table\\nhas 2\\nn rows. An optimization, the method of semantic trees , avoids looking at\\nvariables that do not occur in clauses, and thus saves computation time in many\\ncases, but in the worst case it is likewise exponential.\\nIn resolution, in the worst case the number of derived clauses grows exponen-\\ntially with the number of initial clauses. To decide between the two processes, we\\ncan therefore use the rule of thumb that in the case of many clauses with few\\nvariables, the truth table method is preferable, and in the case of few clauses with\\nmany variables, resolution will probably ﬁnish faster.\\nThe question remains: can proof in propositional logic go faster? Are there better\\nalgorithms? The answer: probably not. After all, S. Cook, the founder of com-\\nplexity theory, has shown that the 3-SAT problem is NP-complete. 3-SAT is the set\\nof all CNF formulas whose clauses have exactly three literals. Thus it is clear that\\nthere is probably (modulo the P/NP problem) no polynomial algorithm for 3-SAT,\\nand thus probably not a general one either. For Horn clauses, however, there is an\\nalgorithm in which the computation time for testing satis ﬁability grows only lin-\\nearly as the number of literals in the formula increases.\\n36 2 Propositional Logic'),\n",

The reason for this is the immense combinatorial\\nsearch space. Even if there are only very few pairs of clauses in KB ^ ¬Q in the\\nbeginning, the prover generates a new clause with every resolution step, which\\nincreases the number of possible resolution steps in the next iteration. Thus it has\\nlong been attempted to reduce the search space using special strategies, preferably\\nwithout losing completeness. The most important strategies are the following.\\nUnit resolution prioritizes resolution steps in which one of the two clauses\\nconsists of only one literal, called a unit clause. This strategy preserves com-\\npleteness and leads in many cases, but not always, to a reduction of the search\\nspace. It therefore is a heuristic process (see Sect. 6.3).\\nOne obtains a guaranteed reduction of the search space by application of the set\\nof support strategy . Here a subset of KB ^ ¬Q is de ﬁned as the set of support\\n(SOS). Every resolution step must involve a clause from the SOS, and the resolvent\\nis added to the SOS. This strategy is incomplete. It becomes complete when it is\\nensured that the set of clauses is satis ﬁable without the SOS (see Exercise 3.7 on\\npage 64). The negated query ¬Q is often used as the initial SOS.\\nIn input resolution , a clause from the input set KB ^ ¬Q must be involved in\\nevery resolution step. This strategy also reduces the search space, but at the cost of\\ncompleteness.\\nWith the pure literal rule all clauses that contain literals for which there are no\\ncomplementary literals in other clauses can be deleted. This rule reduces the search\\nspace and is complete, and therefore it is used by practically all resolution provers.\\nIf the literals of a clause K\\n1 represent a subset of the literals of the clause K2, then\\nK2 can be deleted. For example, the clause\\nðrainingðtodayÞ) street wetðtodayÞÞ\\nis redundant if street_wet(today) is already valid. This important reduction step is\\ncalled subsumption. Subsumption, too, is complete.\\n3.5.2 Equality\\nEquality is an especially inconvenient cause of explosive growth of the search\\nspace. If we add ( 3.1) on page 45 and the equality axioms formulated in ( 3.2)o n\\npage 45 to the knowledge base, then the symmetry clause ¬x = y _ y = x can be\\nuniﬁed with every positive or negated equation, for example. This leads to the\\nderivation of new clauses and equations upon which equality axioms can again be\\napplied, and so on. The transitivity and substitution axioms have similar conse-\\nquences. Because of this, special inference rules for equality have been developed\\nwhich get by without explicit equality axioms and, in particular, reduce the search\\n3.5 Resolution 55'),\n",

An overview of the most\\nimportant systems can be found in [McC].\\nOne of the oldest resolution provers was developed at the Argonne National\\nLaboratory in Chicago. Based on early developments starting in 1963, Otter\\n[Kal01], was created in 1984. Above all, Otter was successfully applied in\\nspecialized areas of mathematics, as one can learn from its home page:\\n“Currently, the main application of Otter is research in abstract algebra and formal logic.\\nOtter and its predecessors have been used to answer many open questions in the areas of\\nﬁnite semigroups, ternary Boolean algebra, logic calculi, combinatory logic, group theory,\\nlattice theory, and algebraic geometry. ”\\nSeveral years later the University of Technology, Munich, created the high-\\nperformance prover SETHEO [LSBB92] based on fast PROLOG technology. With\\nthe goal of reaching even higher performance, an implementation for parallel\\ncomputers was developed under the name PARTHEO. It turned out that it was not\\nworthwhile to use special hardware in theorem provers, as is also the case in other\\nareas of AI, because these computers are very quickly overtaken by faster pro-\\ncessors and more intelligent algorithms. Munich is also the birthplace of E [Sch02],\\nan award-winning modern equation prover, which we will become familiar with in\\nthe next example.

We humans use intuitive calculi that work on a\\nhigher level and often carry out many of the simple inferences of an automated\\nprover in one step. Furthermore, we use lemmas, that is, derived true formulas that\\nwe already know and therefore do not need to re-prove them each time.

But even they cannot\\nyet compete with human experts.\\nA further, much more important advantage of us humans is intuition, without\\nwhich we could not solve any dif ﬁcult problems [PS09]. The attempt to formalize\\nintuition causes problems. Experience in applied AI projects shows that in complex\\ndomains such as medicine (see Sect. 7.3) or mathematics, most experts are unable\\nto formulate this intuitive meta-knowledge verbally, much less to formalize it.\\nTherefore we cannot program this knowledge or integrate it into calculi in the form\\nof heuristics.

Thus backtracking over this spot is unnecessary. We\\ncan optimize this with a cut:\\n1 max(X,Y,X) :- X >= Y, !.\\n2 max(X,Y,Y).\\nThus the second clause is only called if it is really necessary, that is, if the\\nﬁrst clause fails. However, this optimization makes the program harder to\\nunderstand.\\nAnother possibility for execution control is the built-in predicate fail, which is\\nnever true. In the family relationship example we can quite simply print out all\\nchildren and their parents with the query\\n?- child\\\\_fact(X,Y,Z), write(X), write(’ is a child of ’),\\nwrite(Y), write(’ and ’), write(Z), write(’.’), nl, fail.\\nThe corresponding output is\\noscar is a child of karen and frank.\\nmary is a child of karen and frank.\\neve is a child of anne and oscar.\\n...\\nNo.\\nwhere the predicate nl causes a line break in the output.

This answer\\nis not logically correct. Speci ﬁcally, it is not possible to prove that there is no object\\nwith the name ulla. Here the prover E would correctly answer “No proof\\nfound.” Thus if PROLOG answers No, this only means that the query Q cannot\\nbe proved. For this, however, ¬Q must not necessarily be proved.

However, it is important for procedural execution using SLD-resolution\\n(Sect. 2.5).

This is the only way it is possible to have repro-\\nducible execution of logic programs and, therefore, well-de ﬁned procedural\\nsemantics.\\nIndeed, there are certainly problem statements which cannot be described by\\nHorn clauses.

The reason is the penguin problem\\ndiscussed in Sect. 4.3. The fact penguin(tweety) does ensure that penguin\\n(tweety) is true. However, it does not rule out that raven(tweety) is also\\ntrue. To rule this out with additional axioms is very inconvenient (Sect. 4.3).\\n5.6 A Planning Example 85'),\n",

This iterative raising of the depth limit is called iterative deepening .\\nWe must augment the depth- ﬁrst search program given in Fig. 6.8 on page 99\\nwith the two additional parameters “Depth” and “Limit”. “Depth” is raised by one\\nat the recursive call, and the head line of the while loop is replaced by “While\\nNewNodes 6¼; And Depth < Limit ”. The modi ﬁed algorithm is represented in\\nFig. 6.11 on page 101.\\nAnalysis The memory requirement is the same as in depth- ﬁrst search. One could\\nargue that repeatedly re-starting depth- ﬁrst search at depth zero causes a lot of\\nredundant work. For large branching factors this is not the case. We now show that\\nFig. 6.9 Execution of depth- ﬁrst search. All nodes at depth three are unsuccessful and cause\\nbacktracking.

In the\\n8-puzzle, for example, every move can be immediately undone, which leads to\\nunnecessary cycles of length two. Such cycles can be prevented by recording within\\neach node all of its predecessors and, when expanding a node, comparing the newly\\ncreated successor nodes with the predecessor nodes. All of the duplicates found can\\nbe removed from the list of successor nodes. This simple check costs only a small\\nconstant factor of additional memory space and increases the constant computation\\ntime c by an additional constant d for the check itself for a total of c þ d.

If, for example, during\\nbreadth-ﬁrst search with effective branching factor b on a ﬁnite tree of depth d, the\\ncomputation time without the cycle check is c /C1b\\nd, the required time with the cycle\\ncheck becomes\\nðc þ dÞ/C1ðb /C0 1Þd:\\nThe check thus practically always results in a clear gain because reducing the branching\\nfactor by one has an exponentially growing effect as the depth increases, whereas the\\nadditional computation time d only somewhat increases the constant factor.\\nNow the question arises as to how a check on cycles of arbitrary length would\\naffect the search performance. The list of all predecessors must now be stored for each\\nnode, which can be done very ef ﬁciently (see Exercise 6.8 on page 123). During the\\nsearch, each newly created node must now be compared with all its predecessors.

In search trees that are not\\nvery deep, this extra complexity is not important. For search tasks with very deep,\\nweakly branching trees, it may be advantageous to use a hash table [CLR90] to store\\nthe list of predecessors. Lookups in the table can be done in constant time such that\\nthe computation time of the search algorithm only grows by a small constant factor.\\nIn summary, we can conclude that the cycle check implies hardly any additional\\noverhead and is therefore worthwhile for applications with repeatedly occurring\\nnodes.\\n6.3 Heuristic Search\\nHeuristics are problem-solving strategies which in many cases ﬁnd a solution faster\\nthan uninformed search.

From the set of open nodes, the node\\nwith the minimal rating is always expanded ﬁrst. This is achieved by immediately\\nevaluating nodes as they are expanded and sorting them into the list of open nodes.\\nThe list may then contain nodes from different depths in the tree.\\nBecause heuristic evaluation of states is very important for the search, we will\\ndifferentiate from now on between states and their associated nodes. The node\\ncontains the state and further information relevant to the search, such as its depth in\\nthe search tree and the heuristic rating of the state.

Despite this, A ★\\ncan no longer compete with IDA ★ beyond depth 14 because the cost of sorting in\\nnew nodes pushes up the time per step so much.\\nA computation of the effective branching factor according to ( 6.1) on page 96\\nyields values of about 2.8 for uninformed search. This number is consistent with\\nthe value from Sect. 6.1. Heuristic h\\n1 reduces the branching factor to values of\\nabout 1.5 and h2 to about 1.3. We can see in the table that a small reduction of\\nthe branching factor from 1.5 to 1.3 gives us a big advantage in computation\\ntime.\\nHeuristic search thus has an important practical signi ﬁcance because it can solve\\nproblems which are far out of reach for uninformed search.\\n6.3.6 Summary\\nOf the various search algorithms for uninformed search, iterative deepening is the\\nonly practical one because it is complete and can get by with very little memory.\\nHowever, for dif ﬁcult combinatorial search problems, even iterative deepening\\nusually fails due to the size of the search space. Heuristic search helps here through\\nits reduction of the effective branching factor. The IDA\\n★-algorithm, like iterative\\ndeepening, is complete and requires very little memory.\\nHeuristics naturally only give a signi ﬁcant advantage if the heuristic is “good”.\\nWhen solving dif ﬁcult search problems, the developer ’s actual task consists of\\ndesigning heuristics which greatly reduce the effective branching factor. In Sect. 6.5\\nwe will deal with this problem and also show how machine learning techniques can\\nbe used to automatically generate heuristics.\\nIn closing, it remains to note that heuristics have no performance advantage for\\nunsolvable problems because the unsolvability of a problem can only be estab-\\nlished when the complete search tree has been searched through. For decidable\\nproblems such as the 8-puzzle this means that the whole search tree must be\\ntraversed up to a maximal depth whether a heuristic is being used or not. The\\nheuristic is always a disadvantage in this case, attributable to the computational\\ncost of evaluating the heuristic. This disadvantage can usually be estimated by a\\nconstant factor independent of the size of the problem. For undecidable problems\\nsuch as the proof of PL1 formulas, the search tree can be in ﬁnitely deep. This\\nmeans that, in the unsolvable case, the search potentially never ends. In summary\\nwe can say the following: for solvable problems, heuristics often reduce compu-\\ntation time dramatically, but for unsolvable problems the cost can even be higher\\nwith heuristics.\\n6.3 Heuristic Search 113'),\n",

In contrast, backgammon is non-deterministic because its child state depends\\non the result of a dice roll. These games are all observable because every player\\nalways knows the complete game state. Many card games, such as poker, for\\nexample, are only partially observable because the player does not know the other\\nplayers’ cards, or only has partial knowledge about them.\\nThe problems discussed so far in this chapter were deterministic and observable.\\nIn the following we will look at games which, too, are deterministic and observable.\\nFurthermore, we will limit ourselves to zero-sum games. These are games in which\\nevery gain one player makes means a loss of the same value for the opponent. The\\nsum of the gain and loss is always equal to zero. This is true of the games chess,\\ncheckers, Othello, and Go, mentioned above.\\n6.4.1 Minimax Search\\nThe goal of each player is to make optimal moves that result in victory. In principle\\nit is possible to construct a search tree and completely search through it (like with\\nthe 8-puzzle) for a series of moves that will result in victory. However, there are\\nseveral peculiarities to watch out for:\\n1. The effective branching factor in chess is around 30 to 35. In a typical game\\nwith 50 moves per player, the search tree has more than 30\\n100 /C25 10148 leaf\\nnodes. Thus there is no chance to fully explore the search tree. Additionally,\\nchess is often played with a time limit. Because of this real-time requirement ,\\nthe search must be limited to an appropriate depth in the tree, for example eight\\nhalf-moves. Since among the leaf nodes of this depth-limited tree there are\\nnormally no solution nodes (that is, nodes which terminate the game) a heuristic\\nevaluation function B for board positions is used. The level of play of the\\nprogram strongly depends on the quality of this evaluation function. Therefore\\nwe will further treat this subject in Sect. 6.5.\\n2. In the following we will call the player whose game we wish to optimize Max,\\nand his opponent Min. The opponent ’s (Min ’s) moves are not known in\\nadvance, and thus neither is the actual search tree. This problem can be elegantly\\nsolved by assuming that the opponent always makes the best move he can. The\\nhigher the evaluation B(s) for position s, the better position s is for the player\\nMax and the worse it is for his opponent Min. Max tries to maximize the\\nevaluation of his moves, whereas Min makes moves that result in as low an\\nevaluation as possible.\\nA search tree with four half-moves and evaluations of all leaves is given in\\nFig. 6.19 on page 115.

Alpha-beta pruning works with depth- ﬁrst search\\nup to a preset depth limit. In this way the search tree is searched through from left to\\nright. Like in minimax search, in the minimum nodes the minimum is generated\\nfrom the minimum value of the successor nodes and in the maximum nodes like-\\nwise the maximum. In Fig. 6.20 this process is depicted for the tree from Fig. 6.19.\\nAt the node marked a, all other successors can be ignored after the ﬁrst child is\\nevaluated as the value 1 because the minimum is sure to be /C20 1.

Here\\nthere are fundamentally two approaches. The classical way uses the knowledge of\\nhuman experts. The knowledge engineer is given the usually dif ﬁcult task of for-\\nmalizing the expert’ s implicit knowledge in the form of a computer program. We\\nnow want to show how this process can be simpli ﬁed in the chess program\\nexample.\\nIn the ﬁrst step, experts are questioned about the most important factors in the\\nselection of a move. Then it is attempted to quantify these factors. We obtain a list\\nof relevant features or attributes. These are then (in the simplest case) combined into\\na linear evaluation function B(s) for positions, which could look like:\\nBðsÞ¼ a\\n1 /C1material þ a2 /C1pawn structure þ a3 /C1king safety\\nþ a4 /C1knight in center þ a5 /C1bishop diagonal coverage þ /C1/C1/C1;ð6:3Þ\\nwhere “material” is by far the most important feature and is calculated by\\nmaterial ¼ material(own teamÞ/C0 material(opponent)\\nwith\\nmaterial(team) ¼ num pawnsðteamÞ/C1100 þ num knightsðteamÞ/C1300\\nþ num bishopsðteamÞ/C1300 þ num rooksðteamÞ/C1500\\nþ num queensðteamÞ/C1900\\nNearly all chess programs make a similar evaluation for material. However, there\\nare big differences for all other features, which we will not go into here [Fra05, Lar00].\\nIn the next step the weights ai of all features must be determined. These are set\\nintuitively after discussion with experts, then changed after each game based on\\npositive and negative experience. The fact that this optimization process is very\\nexpensive and furthermore that the linear combination of features is very limited\\nsuggests the use of machine learning.\\n6.5.1 Learning of Heuristics\\nWe now want to automatically optimize the weights ai of the evaluation function\\nB(s) from ( 6.3). In this approach the expert is only asked about the relevant features\\nf1(s), … , fn(s) for game state s. Then a machine learning process is used with the\\ngoal of ﬁnding an evaluation function that is as close to optimal as possible.

In principle, the same\\nthing that is done by the developer is now being taken care of automatically by the\\nlearning process.\\nAs easy as this sounds, it is very dif ﬁcult in practice. A central problem with\\nimproving the position rating based on won or lost matches is known today as the\\ncredit assignment problem. We do in fact have a rating at the end of the game, but\\nno ratings for the individual moves. Thus the agent carries out many actions but\\ndoes not receive any positive or negative feedback until the very end. How should it\\nthen assign this feedback to the many actions taken in the past? And how should it\\nimprove its actions in that case? The exciting ﬁeld of reinforcement learning\\ndeals with these questions (see Chap. 10).\\nMonte Carlo tree search (MCTS) [KS06] works quite similarly. To improve the\\nheuristic rating of a game state s, a random number of search tree branches starting\\nfrom this state are either explored to the end and evaluated, or stopped at a certain\\ndepth and then the leaf nodes are evaluated heuristically. The evaluation B(s)o f\\nstate s is given as the mean of all leaf node scores. The use of MCTS paths requires\\nonly a small part of the entire exponentially exploding tree to be searched. This is\\nillustrated in Fig. 6.22. For many computer-simulated games, such as chess, this\\nalgorithm can be used to achieve better play for the same computational effort or to\\nreduce computational effort for the same dif ﬁculty level [KS06].

Just a few years later, in 1955, Arthur\\nSamuel wrote a program that played checkers and could improve its own param-\\neters through a simple learning process.

Especially noteworthy is the expert sys-\\ntem for diagnosis of acute abdominal pain, developed by de Dombal in Great Britain.\\nIt was made public in 1972, thus distinctly earlier than the famous system MYCIN.\\nNearly all of the formal diagnostic processes used in medicine to date have been\\nbased on scores. Score systems are extremely easy to apply: For each value of a\\nsymptom (for example fever or lower right stomach pain) the doctor notes a certain\\nnumber of points. If the sum of the points is over a certain value (threshold), a certain\\ndecision is recommended (for example operation). For n symptoms S\\n1, … , Sn a\\nscore for appendicitis can be described formally as\\nDiagnose ¼ Appendicitis if w1S1 þ /C1/C1/C1 þw nSn [H;\\nnegative else.\\n/C26\\nWith scores, a linear combination of symptom values is thus compared with a\\nthreshold Θ. The weights of the symptoms are extracted from databases using\\nstatistical methods. The advantage of scores is their simplicity of application. The\\nweighted sum of the points can be computed by hand easily and a computer is not\\nneeded for the diagnosis.\\nBecause of the linearity of this method, scores are too weak to model complex\\nrelationships. Since the contribution w\\niSi of a symptom Si to the score is calculated\\nindependently of the other symptoms, it is clear that score systems cannot take any\\n“context”into account. Principally, they cannot distinguish between combinations\\nof symptoms, for example they cannot distinguish between the white blood cell\\ncount of an old patient and that of a young patient.\\nFor a ﬁxed given set of symptoms, conditional probability is much more\\npowerful than scores for making predictions because the latter cannot describe the\\ndependencies between different symptoms. We can show that scores implicitly\\nassume that all symptoms are independent.\\nWhen using scores, yet another problem comes up. To arrive at a good diagnosis\\nquality, we must put strict requirements on the databases used to statistically\\ndetermine the weights w\\ni. In particular they must be representative of the set of\\npatients in the area in which the diagnosis system is used. This is often dif ﬁcult, if\\nnot impossible, to guarantee. In such cases, scores and other statistical methods\\neither cannot be used, or will have a high rate of errors.\\n7.3.2 Hybrid Probabilistic Knowledge Base\\nComplex probabilistic relationships appear frequently in medicine. With L EXMED,\\nthese relationships can be modeled well and calculated quickly. Here the use of\\nprobabilistic propositions, with which uncertain and incomplete information can be\\nexpressed and processed in an intuitive and mathematically grounded way, is\\nessential.

At point (0, 0) all\\nthree curves intersect. The corresponding diagnosis system would classify all cases\\nas negative. The other extreme value (1, 1) corresponds to a system which would\\ndecide to do the operation for every patient and thus has a sensitivity of 1. We could\\ncall the ROC curve the characteristic curve for two-value diagnostic systems. The\\nideal diagnostic system would have a characteristic curve which consists only of the\\npoint (0, 1), and thus has 100% speci ﬁcity and 100% sensitivity.\\nNow let us analyse the ROC curve. At a sensitivity of 88%, L\\nEXMED attains a\\nspeciﬁcity of 87% ( k = 0.6). For comparison, the Ohmann score, an established,\\nwell-known score for appendicitis is given [OMYL96, ZSR+99]. Because L EXMED\\nis above or to the left of the Ohmann score almost everywhere, its average quality of\\ndiagnosis is clearly better. This is not surprising because scores are simply too weak\\nto model interesting propositions. In Sect. 8.7 and in Exercise 8.17 on page 242 we\\nwill show that scores are equivalent to the special case of naive Bayes, that is, to the\\nassumption that all symptoms are pairwise independent when the diagnosis is\\nknown. When comparing L\\nEXMED with scores it should, however, be mentioned that\\na statistically representative database was used for the Ohmann score, but a\\nnon-representative database enhanced with expert knowledge was used for L\\nEXMED.\\nTo get an idea of the quality of the L EXMED data in comparison to the Ohmann data, a\\nlinear score was calculated using the least squares method (see Sect. 9.4.1), which is\\nalso drawn for comparison. Furthermore, a neural network was trained on the\\nL\\nEXMED data with the RProp algorithm (see Sect. 9.5). The strength of combining\\ndata and expert knowledge is displayed clearly in the difference between the L EXMED\\ncurve and the curves of the score system and the RProp algorithm.\\n7.3.7 Application Areas and Experiences\\nLEXMED should not replace the judgment of an experienced surgeon. However,\\nbecause a specialist is not always available in a clinical setting, a L EXMED query\\noffers a substantive second opinion. Especially interesting and worthwhile is the\\napplication of the system in a clinical ambulance and for general practitioners.\\nThe learning capability of L\\nEXMED, which makes it possible to take into account\\nfurther symptoms, further patient data, and further rules, also presents new possi-\\nbilities in the clinic. For especially rare groups which are dif ﬁcult to diagnose, for\\nexample children under six years of age, L\\nEXMED can use data from pediatricians or\\nother special databases, to support even experienced surgeons.\\nAside from direct use in diagnosis, L EXMED also supports quality assurance\\nmeasures. For example, insurance companies can compare the quality of diagnosis\\nof hospitals with that of expert systems. By further developing the cost matrix\\ncreated in L\\nEXMED (with the consent of doctors, insurance, and patients), the quality\\nof physician diagnoses, computer diagnoses, and other medical institutions will\\nbecome easier to compare.\\nL\\nEXMED has pointed to a new way of constructing automatic diagnostic systems.\\nUsing the language of probability theory and the MaxEnt algorithm, inductively,\\n7.3 L EXMED, an Expert System for Diagnosing Appendicitis 157'),\n",

One reason for this is that\\nthere is no free market to promote better quality (here better diagnoses) through its\\nselection mechanisms. Furthermore, in medicine the time for broad use of intelli-\\ngent techniques is not yet at hand — even in 2010. One cause of this could be\\nconservative teachings in this regard in German medical school faculties.\\nA further issue is the desire of many patients for personal advice and care from\\nthe doctor, together with the fear that, with the introduction of expert systems, the\\npatient will only communicate with the machine. This fear, however, is wholly\\nunfounded. Even in the long term, medical expert systems cannot replace the\\ndoctor.

Therefore he has asked his two neighbors, John in the house\\nnext door to the left, and Mary in the house to the right, to call him at his of ﬁce if\\nthey hear his alarm. After a few years Bob knows how reliable John and Mary are\\nand models their calling behavior using conditional probability as follows.\\n17\\nPðJjAlÞ¼ 0:90 PðMjAlÞ¼ 0:70;\\nPðJj:AlÞ¼ 0:05 PðMj:AlÞ¼ 0:01:\\nBecause Mary is hard of hearing, she fails to hear the alarm more often than John.\\nHowever, John sometimes mixes up the alarm at Bob ’s house with the alarms at\\nother houses. The alarm is triggered by a burglary, but can also be triggered by a\\n(weak) earthquake, which can lead to a false alarm because Bob only wants to know\\nabout burglaries while at his of ﬁce. These relationships are modeled by\\nPðAljBur; EarÞ¼ 0:95;\\nPðAljBur; :EarÞ¼ 0:94;\\nPðAlj:Bur; EarÞ¼ 0:29;\\nPðAlj:Bur; :EarÞ¼ 0:001;\\nas well as the a priori probabilities P(Bur) = 0.001 and P(Ear) = 0.002. These two\\nvariables are independent because earthquakes do not make plans based on the\\nhabits of burglars, and conversely there is no way to predict earthquakes, so\\nburglars do not have the opportunity to set their schedule accordingly.\\n16In the naive Bayes method, the independence of all attributes is assumed, and this method has\\nbeen successfully applied to text classi ﬁcation (see Sect. 8.7).\\n17The binary variables J and M stand for the two events “John calls ”, and “Mary calls ”,\\nrespectively, Al for “alarm siren sounds ”, Bur for “burglary”and Ear for “earthquake”.\\n7.4 Reasoning with Bayesian Networks 159'),\n",

The two nodes Bur and Ear are\\nnot linked since the variables are independent. All other nodes have a parent node,\\nwhich makes the reasoning a little more complex.

This means that the nodes are only locally\\nconnected. Because of the local connection, the network becomes modularized,\\nwhich— as in software engineering — leads to a reduction in complexity. In the\\nalarm example the alarm node separates the nodes Bur and Ear from the nodes\\nJ and M. We can also see this clearly in the L\\nEXMED example.\\n18For the case of a node without ancestors the product in this sum is empty.

Design of the network structure : This step is usually performed manually and\\nwill be described in the following.\\n2. Entering the probabilities in the CPTs : Manually entering the values in the case\\nof many variables is very tedious. If (as for example with L EXMED) a database is\\navailable, this step can be automated through estimating the CPT entries by\\ncounting frequencies.\\nWe will now describe the construction of the network in the alarm example (see\\nFig. 7.15). At the beginning we know the two causes Burglary and Earthquake and\\nthe two symptoms John and Mary. However, because John and Mary do not directly\\nreact to a burglar or earthquake, rather only to the alarm, it is appropriate to add this\\nas an additional variable which is not observable by Bob. The process of adding\\nedges starts with the causes, that is, with the variables that have no parent nodes.\\nFirst we choose Burglary and next Earthquake. Now we must check whether\\nEarthquake is independent of Burglary. This is given, and thus no edge is added\\nfrom Burglary to Earthquake. Because Alarm is directly dependent on Burglary and\\nEarthquake, these variables are chosen next and an edge is added from both Bur-\\nglary and Earthquake to Alarm. Then we choose John. Because Alarm and John are\\nnot independent, an edge is added from alarm to John. The same is true for Mary.\\nNow we must check whether John is conditionally independent of Burglary given\\nAlarm. If this is not the case, then another edge must be inserted from Burglary to\\nJohn. We must also check whether edges are needed from Earthquake to John and\\nfrom Burglary or Earthquake to Mary. Because of conditional independence, these\\nfour edges are not necessary. Edges between John and Mary are also unnecessary\\nbecause John and Mary are conditionally independent given Alarm.\\nThe structure of the Bayesian network heavily depends on the chosen variable\\nordering. If the order of variables is chosen to re ﬂect the causal relationship\\nbeginning with the causes and proceeding to the diagnosis variables, then the result\\nwill be a simple network. Otherwise the network may contain signi ﬁcantly more\\nedges. Such non-causal networks are often very dif ﬁcult to understand and have a\\nhigher complexity for reasoning.

Bayesian networks were then intro-\\nduced as a special case of the MaxEnt method.\\nWhy are Bayesian networks a special case of MaxEnt? When building a\\nBayesian network, assumptions about independence are made which are unneces-\\nsary for the MaxEnt method. Furthermore, when building a Bayesian network, all\\nCPTs must be completely ﬁlled in so that a complete probability distribution can be\\nconstructed. Otherwise reasoning is restricted or impossible. With MaxEnt, on the\\nother hand, the developer can formulate all the knowledge he has at his disposal in\\nthe form of probabilities. MaxEnt then completes the model and generates the\\ndistribution. Even if (for example when interviewing an expert) only vague\\npropositions are available, this can be suitably modeled. A proposition such as\\n“I am pretty sure that A is true. ”can for example be modeled using P(A) 2 [0.6, 1]\\nas a probability interval. When building a Bayesian network, a concrete value must\\nbe given for the probability, if necessary by guessing. This means, however, that the\\nexpert or the developer put ad hoc information into the system. One further\\nadvantage of MaxEnt is the possibility of formulating (almost) arbitrary proposi-\\ntions. For Bayesian networks the CPTs must be ﬁlled.\\nThe freedom that the developer has when modeling with MaxEnt can be a\\ndisadvantage (especially for a beginner) because, in contrast to the Bayesian\\napproach, it is not necessarily clear what knowledge should be modeled. When\\nmodeling with Bayesian networks the approach is quite clear: according to causal\\ndependencies, from the causes to the effects, one edge after the other is entered into\\nthe network by testing conditional independence.\\n20 At the end all CPTs are ﬁlled\\nwith values.\\nHowever, the following interesting combinations of the two methods are pos-\\nsible: we begin by building a network according to the Bayesian methodology,\\nenter all the edges accordingly and then ﬁll the CPTs with values. Should certain\\nvalues for the CPTs be unavailable, then they can be replaced with intervals or\\nby other probabilistic logic formulas.

The topic will be introduced in this section,\\nfollowed by important fundamental learning algorithms in the next sections.\\nTheory and terminology will be built up in parallel to this.

Learning vocabulary of a foreign language, or technical terms,\\nor even memorizing a poem can be dif ﬁcult for many people. For computers,\\nhowever, these tasks are quite simple because they are little more than saving text in\\na ﬁle. Thus memorization is uninteresting for AI. In contrast, the acquisition of\\nmathematical skills is usually not done by memorization. For addition of natural\\nnumbers this is not at all possible, because for each of the terms in the sum x + y there\\nare inﬁnitely many values. For each combination of the two values x and y, the triple\\n(x, y, x + y) would have to be stored, which is impossible. For decimal numbers, this\\nis downright impossible. This poses the question: how do we learn mathematics?\\nThe answer reads: The teacher explains the process and the students practice it on\\nexamples until they no longer make mistakes on new examples. After 50 examples\\nthe student (hopefully) understands addition. That is, after only 50 examples he\\ncan apply what was learned to in ﬁnitely many new examples, which to that point\\nwere not seen. This process is known as generalization. We begin with a simple\\nexample.\\nExample 8.1 A fruit farmer wants to automatically divide harvested apples into the\\nmerchandise classes A and B. The sorting device is equipped with sensors to\\nmeasure two features, size and color, and then decide which of the two classes the\\napple belongs to. This is a typical classiﬁcation task . Systems which are capable of\\ndividing feature vectors into a ﬁnite number of classes are called classiﬁers.\\nTo con ﬁgure the machine, apples are hand-picked by a specialist, that is, they\\nare classi ﬁed.

The perceptron and all other neural networks, decision\\ntree learning, and the learning of Bayesian networks are eager learning methods.\\nSince the lazy learning methods need access to the memory with all training data for\\napproximating a new input, they are also called memory-based learning .\\nTo compare these two classes of learning processes, we will use as an example\\nthe task of determining the current avalanche hazard from the amount of newly\\nfallen snow in a certain area of Switzerland.\\n6 In Fig. 8.20 values determined by\\nexperts are entered, which we want to use as training data. During the application of\\na eager learning algorithm which undertakes a linear approximation of the data, the\\ndashed line shown in the ﬁgure is calculated. Due to the restriction to a straight line,\\nthe error is relatively large with a maximum of about 1.5 hazard levels. During lazy\\nlearning, nothing is calculated before a query for the current hazard level arrives.\\nThen the answer is calculated from several nearest neighbors, that is, locally. It\\ncould result in the curve shown in the ﬁgure, which is put together from line\\nsegments and shows much smaller errors. The advantage of the lazy method is its\\nlocality. The approximation is taken locally from the current new snow level and\\nnot globally. Thus for fundamentally equal classes of functions (for example linear\\nfunctions), the lazy algorithms are better.\\nNearest neighbor methods are well suited for all problem situations in which a\\ngood local approximation is needed, but which do not place a high requirement on\\nthe speed of the system.

In the right column, a case similar to the query in the middle column is given.\\nThis stems from the case base, which corresponds to training data in the nearest\\nneighbor method. If we simply took the most similar case, as we do in the nearest\\nneighbor method, then we would end up trying to repair the front light when the\\nrear light is broken. We thus need a reverse transformation of the solution to the\\ndiscovered similar problem back to the query. The most important steps in the\\nsolution to a CBR case are carried out in Fig. 8.22 on page 198.

To answer this question we will at\\nﬁrst restrict ourselves to discrete attributes with ﬁnitely many values. Because the\\nnumber of attributes is also ﬁnite and each attribute can occur at most once per\\npath, there are ﬁnitely many different decision trees. A simple, obvious algorithm\\nfor the construction of a tree would simply generate all trees, then for each tree\\ncalculate the number of erroneous classi ﬁcations of the data, and at the end\\nchoose the tree with the minimum number of errors. Thus we would even have an\\noptimal algorithm (in the sense of errors for the training data) for decision tree\\nlearning.\\nThe obvious disadvantage of this algorithm is its unacceptably high computation\\ntime, as soon as the number of attributes becomes somewhat larger. We will now\\ndevelop a heuristic algorithm which, starting from the root, recursively builds\\nTable 8.4 Variables for the skiing classi ﬁcation problem\\nVariable Value Description\\nSki (goal variable) yes, no Should I drive to the nearest ski resort with enough snow?\\nSun (feature) yes, no Is there sunshine today?\\nSnow_Dist (feature) /C20100, >100 Distance to the nearest ski resort with good snow conditions\\n(over/under 100 km)\\nWeekend (feature) yes, no Is it the weekend today?\\n8.4 Decision Tree Learning 199'),\n",

This law of\\neconomy, also now known as Occam’s razor , is of great importance for machine\\nlearning and data mining.\\nA decision tree is a theory for describing the training data. A different theory for\\ndescribing the data is the data themselves. If the tree classi ﬁes all data without any\\nerrors, but is much more compact and thus more easily understood by humans, then\\nit is preferable according to Occam ’s razor. The same is true for two decision trees\\nof different sizes. Thus the goal of every algorithm for generating a decision tree\\nmust be to generate the smallest possible decision tree for a given error rate. Among\\nall trees with a ﬁxed error rate, the smallest tree should always be selected.\\nUp until now we have not de ﬁned the term error rate precisely. As already\\nmentioned several times, it is important that the learned tree not just memorize the\\ntraining data, rather that it generalizes well. To test the ability of a tree to generalize,\\nwe divide the available data into a set of training data and a set of v. The test data\\nare hidden from the learning algorithm and only used for testing. If a large dataset is\\navailable, such as the appendicitis data, then we can for example use two-thirds of\\nthe data for learning and the remaining third for testing.\\nAside from better comprehensibility, Occam ’s razor has another important jus-\\ntiﬁcation: generalization ability. The more complex the model (here a decision tree),\\nthe more details are represented, but to the same extent the less is the model\\ntransferable to new data. This relationship is illustrated in Fig. 8.27. Decision trees\\nof various sizes were trained against the appendicitis data. In the graph, classi ﬁ-\\ncation errors on both the training data and on the test data are given. The error rate\\non the training data decreases monotonically with the size of the tree. Up to a tree\\nsize of 55 nodes, the error rate on test data also decreases. If the tree grows further,\\nhowever, then the error rate starts to increase again!

The most\\nobvious algorithm is called cross-validation. During construction of the tree, the\\nerror on the test data is measured in parallel. As soon as the error rises signi ﬁcantly,\\nthe tree with the minimum error is saved. This algorithm is used by the CART\\nsystem mentioned earlier.\\nC4.5 works somewhat differently. First, using the algorithm G\\nENERATEDECI-\\nSIONTREE from Fig. 8.26 on page 207, it generates a tree which is usually over ﬁt.\\nThen, using pruning, it attempts to cut away nodes of the tree until the error on the\\ntest data, estimated by the error on the training data, begins to rise. 8 Like the con-\\nstruction of the tree, this is also a greedy algorithm. This means that once a node is\\npruned, it cannot be re-inserted, even if this later turns out to be better.\\n8.4.8 Missing Values\\nFrequently individual attribute values are missing from the training data.

We can assign the attribute the most\\nfrequent value from the whole dataset or the most frequent of all data points from\\nthe same class. It is even better to substitute the probability distribution of all\\nattribute values for the missing attribute value and to split the training example into\\nbranches according to this distribution. This is incidentally a reason for the\\noccurrence of non-integer values in the expressions in parentheses next to the leaf\\nnodes of the C4.5 tree.\\nMissing values can occur not only during learning, but also during classi ﬁcation.\\nThese are handled in the same way as during learning.\\n8It would be better to use the error on the test data directly.

The reasons\\nfor this are its simple application and speed. On a dataset of about 10 000 L EXMED\\ndata points with 15 attributes each, C4.5 requires about 0.3 s for learning. This is\\nvery fast compared to other learning algorithms.\\nFor the user it is also important, however, that the decision tree as a learned\\nmodel can be understood and potentially changed. It is also not dif ﬁcult to auto-\\nmatically transform a decision tree into a series of if-then-else statements and thus\\nefﬁciently build it into an existing program.\\nBecause a greedy algorithm is used for construction of the tree as well as during\\npruning, the trees are in general suboptimal. The discovered decision tree does usually\\nhave a relatively small error rate. However, there is potentially a better tree, because the\\nheuristic greedy search of C4.5 prefers small trees and attributes with high information\\ngain at the top of the tree. For attributes with many values, the presented formula for the\\ninformation gain shows weaknesses. Alternatives to this are given in [Mit97].\\n8.5 Cross-Validation and Overfitting\\nAs discussed in Sect. 8.4.7, many learning algorithms have the problem of over-\\nﬁtting. Powerful learning algorithms, such as for example decision tree learning,\\ncan adapt the complexity of the learned model to the complexity of the training\\ndata. This leads to over ﬁtting if there is noise in the data.\\nWith cross-validation one attempts to optimize the model complexity such that it\\nminimizes the classi ﬁcation or approximation error on an unknown test data set.\\nThis requires the model complexity to be controllable by a parameter c. For\\ndecision trees this is, for example, the size of the tree. For the k nearest neighbor\\nmethod from Sect. 8.3, the parameter is k, the number of nearest neighbors, while\\nfor neural networks it is the number of hidden neurons (see Chap. 9).\\nWe vary a parameter c while training the algorithm on a training data set and\\nchoose the value of c that minimizes the error on an independent testing data set.\\nk-ary cross-validation works according to the following schema:\\nCrossValidation(X,k )\\nPartition data into k equally sized blocks X = X1 ∪ ... ∪ Xk\\nFor all γ ∈{ γmin,...,γ max}\\nFor all i ∈{ 1,...,k }\\nTrain a model of complexity γ on X\\\\Xi\\nCompute the error E(γ, Xi) on the test set Xi\\nCompute the mean error E(γ)= 1\\nk\\n∑ k\\ni=1\\nE(γ, Xi)\\nChoose the value γopt = argmin γ E(γ) with smallest mean error\\nTrain the ﬁnal model with complexity γopt on the whole data set X\\n8.4 Decision Tree Learning 213'),\n",

The resulting increase in computational complexity is usually acceptable.\\nFor small training sets, it is preferable to train on all n feature vectors if possible.\\nThen one can choose k ¼ n, which yields what is called leave-one-out\\ncross-validation.\\nCross-validation is the most important and most used automatic optimiza-\\ntion method for model complexity. It solves the over ﬁtting problem.\\nWe can gain additional insight into this problem from short look at the so called\\nbias variance tradeoff . If an overly simple model is used, this forces\\nthe non-optimal approximation of the data in a certain direction (bias). On the\\nother hand, if an overly complex model is used, it will tend to over ﬁt any data\\nset. Thus, for a new data sample from the same distribution, it may learn a very\\ndifferent model. The model therefore varies greatly for a change in the data\\n(variance).\\nThis relationship can be illustrated by the example of function approximation\\nusing polynomials. If one chooses the degree of the polymonial as the complexity\\nparameter c, degree 1 approximates a line, which is not a good approximation for\\nnon-trivial data. If, on the other hand, the polynomial degree equals n /C0 1 for\\nn points, it tends to hit every point and reduce the error on the training data to zero.\\nThis can be seen in Fig. 8.28 left on page 215, in which eight data points have been\\ngenerated using\\nyðxÞ¼ sinðxÞþ gð0; 0:2Þ;\\nwhere g(0, 0.2) generates normally distributed noise with zero mean and a standard\\ndeviation of 0.2.\\nIn the left image, in addition to the data points, the underlying sine function\\n(black) is inscribed, as well as a straight line (red) approximated using the method\\nof least squares (see Sect. 9.4 oder [Ert15]). In addition, a seventh degree poly-\\nnomial (green) is interpolated through the points, hitting each point, as well as a\\nfourth degree polynomial (blue), which comes closest to the sine curve. In the right\\nimage, the same approximations were carried out again on eight new data points.\\nOne can see very nicely that despite differing data, both straight lines deviate\\ngreatly from the data (large bias), but have a similar function graph (very small\\nvariance). Both seventh degree polynomials, on the other hand, ﬁt the data perfectly\\n(zero bias), but they have very different function graphs (very large variance). This\\nis an obvious over ﬁtting effect.

We are looking for a set of directed edges without cycles between the\\nnodes V\\n1, … , Vn, that is, a directed acyclic graph (DAG) which reproduces the\\nunderlying data as well as possible.\\nFirst we observe the search space. The number of different DAGs grows more\\nthan exponentially with the number of nodes. For ﬁve nodes there are 29281 and\\nfor nine nodes about 10 15 different DAGs [MDBM00]. Thus an uninformed\\ncombinatorial search (see Sect. 6.2) in the space of all graphs with a given set of\\nvariables is hopeless if the number of variables grows. Therefore heuristic algo-\\nrithms must be used. This poses the question of an evaluation function for\\nBayesian networks. It is possible to measure the classi ﬁcation error of a network\\nduring application to a set of test data, as is done, for example, in C4.5 (see\\nSect. 8.4). For this, however, the probabilities calculated by the Bayesian network\\nmust be mapped to a decision.\\nA direct measurement of the quality of a network can be taken over the prob-\\nability distribution. We assume that, before the construction of the network from the\\ndata, we could determine (estimate) the distribution. Then we begin the search in\\nthe space of all DAGs, estimate the value of the CPTs for each DAG (that is, for\\neach Bayesian network) using the data, and from that we calculate the distribution\\nand compare it to the distribution known from the data. For the comparison of\\ndistributions we will obviously need a distance metric.\\nLet us consider the weather prediction example from Exercise 7.3 on page 172\\nwith the three variables Sky, Bar, Prec, and the distribution\\nPðSky; Bar; PrecÞ¼ð 0:40; 0:07; 0:08; 0:10; 0:09; 0:11; 0:03; 0:12Þ:\\nIn Fig. 8.29 on page 217 two Bayesian networks are presented, which we will now\\ncompare with respect to their quality. Each of these networks makes an assumption\\nof independence, which is validated in that we determine the distribution of the\\nnetwork and then compare this with the original distribution (see Exercise 8.16 on\\npage 241).\\nBecause, for constant predetermined variables, the distribution is clearly repre-\\nsented by a vector of constant length, we can calculate the Euclidian norm of the\\ndifference of the two vectors as a distance between distributions.

After this pre ﬁltering, the\\nremaining emails are classi ﬁed by the naive Bayes classi ﬁer according to their\\nactual content, in other words, according to the text.

If the errors used for\\ntraining are not representative for the device, i.e. if some types of errors are\\nmissing in the training data, then the learned class-separating hypersurface in the\\nfeature space will often lead to false-positive classi ﬁcations.\\nIn such cases, it is not possible to train a two-class classiﬁ er in the standard way.\\nInstead, one can use one-class learning, which gets by with data from one class\\nduring training.\\nAssume that there is no negative data are available. Positive data, i.e. data from\\nerror-free operation, however, are available in suf ﬁcient amount. Thus a learning\\nalgorithm is needed which can, based on the error-free data, capture all error-free\\noperational states of the device and classify all others as negative.\\nFor this purpose, there are a number of different algorithms known as one-class\\nlearning algorithms [Tax01], such as nearest neighbor data description (NNDD),\\nsupport vector data description (SVDD, see also Sect. 9.6), etc. In statistics, these\\nand related algorithms fall under the category of outlier detection.\\nOne of the best known algorithms today is the local outlier factor (LOF,\\n[BKNS00]), which calculates an outlier score for a point that is to be classi ﬁed\\nbased on its density estimate. For large data sets with millions of points, and for\\nhigh-dimensional data points with thousands of dimensions, the algorithms dis-\\ncussed so far are not suitable. The EXPoSE algorithm presented in [SEP16] has a\\nfailure rate about as low as that of LOF, but it is suitable for large high-dimensional\\ndata sets due to its constant computation time. With the simple example of NNDD\\nwe will now brie ﬂy introduce the one-class learning principle.\\n8.8.1 Nearest Neighbor Data Description\\nSimilar to the nearest neighbor method from Sect. 8.3, the nearest neighbor data\\ndescription algorithm belongs to the category of lazy learning algorithms. During\\nlearning, the only things that happen are normalization and storage of the feature\\nvectors. Thus the quali ﬁer “lazy” learning. Normalization of each individual feature\\nis necessary in order to give each feature the same weight. Without normalization, a\\nfeature in the range ½0; 10\\n/C0 4/C138would be lost in the noise of another feature in the\\nrange ½/C0 10000; þ 10000/C138. Thus all features are linearly scaled onto the interval\\n[0, 1]. 9 The actual nearest neighbor algorithm ﬁrst comes into play during\\nclassiﬁcation.\\n9Feature scaling is necessary or advantageous for many machine learning algorithms.\\n8.8 One-Class Learning 223'),\n",

In many cases, users have no idea what a sensible number of clusters would\\nbe, rather they simply want a “good” partitioning, i.e. separation of their n data points\\ninto clusters. Because there is, unfortunately, no absolute and generally accepted\\nstandard for the quality of a partition, we present a approved heuristic method for\\nevaluating a clustering using the silhouette width criterion presented in [Rou87].\\nBefore we discuss this criterion, let us ﬁrst show how it can be applied. Assume\\nthat we had a program that could combinatorially enumerate all possible partitions\\nfor a set of n data points. Then we could simply apply the silhouette width criterion\\nto each partition and use the maximum to determine the best partition. But because\\nthe number of partitions grows quickly with the number of data points, this method\\nis not practical. We could, however, simply apply one of the presented clustering\\nalgorithms (for example k-means), let it run for k from 1 to n, and then use the\\nsilhouette width criterion to determine the best k and its respective partition.\\nWhat we are still missing is such a criterion that measures the quality of a\\npartition. The idea, very roughly, is as follows: the mean distance between two\\narbitrary points within the same cluster should be smaller than the distance between\\ntwo arbitrary points that are in different neighboring clusters. The ratio of the mean\\ndistance between points in neighboring clusters and the mean distance between\\npoints within the cluster should be maximized.\\nLet the data points ðx\\n1; ... ; xnÞ be given, as well as a clustering function\\nc : xi 7! cðxiÞ;\\nwhich assigns each point to a cluster. Let /C22dði;‘ Þ be the mean distance from xi to all\\npoints ( 6¼ xi) in cluster ‘. Then aðiÞ¼ /C22dði; cðxiÞÞ is the mean distance from xi to all\\nother points in its own cluster.

These algorithms are stable and ef ﬁciently usable in\\nvarious applications and thus belong to the standard repertoire in AI and data\\nmining. The same is true for the clustering algorithms, which work without a\\n“supervisor” and can be found, for example, in search engine applications. Rein-\\nforcement learning as another ﬁeld of machine learning uses no supervisor either. In\\ncontrast to supervised learning, where the learner receives the correct actions or\\nanswers as the labels in the training data, in reinforcement learning only now and\\nthen positive or negative feedback is received from the environment. In Chap. 10\\nwe will show how this works.

We humans owe our intelligence\\nand our ability to learn various motor and intellectual capabilities to the brain ’s\\ncomplex relays and adaptivity. For many centuries biologists, psychologists, and\\ndoctors have tried to understand how the brain functions. Around 1900 came the\\nrevolutionary realization that these tiny physical building blocks of the brain, the\\nnerve cells and their connections, are responsible for awareness, associations,\\nthoughts, consciousness, and the ability to learn.\\nThe ﬁrst big step toward neural networks in AI was made 1943 by McCulloch and\\nPitts in an article entitled “A logical calculus of the ideas immanent in nervous activity ”\\n[AR88]. They were the ﬁrst to present a mathematical model of the neuron as the basic\\nswitching element of the brain. This article laid the foundation for the construction of\\nartiﬁcial neural networks and thus for this very important branch of AI.\\nWe could consider the ﬁeld of modeling and simulation of neural networks to be\\nthe bionics branch within AI.\\n1 Nearly all areas of AI attempt to recreate cognitive\\nprocesses, such as in logic or in probabilistic reasoning. However, the tools used for\\nmodeling— namely mathematics, programming languages, and digital computers —\\nhave very little in common with the human brain. With arti ﬁcial neural networks,\\nthe approach is different. Starting from knowledge about the function of natural\\nneural networks, we attempt to model, simulate, and even reconstruct them in\\nhardware. Every researcher in this area faces the fascinating and exciting challenge\\nof comparing results with the performance of humans.\\nIn this chapter we will attempt to outline the historical progression by de ﬁning a\\nmodel of the neuron and its interconnectivity, starting from the most important\\nbiological insights. Then we will present several important and fundamental\\nmodels: the Hop ﬁeld model, two simple associative memory models, and the —\\nexceedingly important in practice — backpropagation algorithm.\\n1Bionics is concerned with unlocking the “discoveries of living nature ” and its innovative\\nconversion into technology [Wik13].\\n© Springer International Publishing AG 2017\\nW.

Besides\\nthe cell body, the neuron has an axon, which can make local connections to other\\nneurons over the dendrites. The axon can, however, grow up to a meter long in the\\nform of a nerve ﬁber through the body.\\nThe cell body of the neuron can store small electrical charges, similarly to a\\ncapacitor or battery. This storage is loaded by incoming electrical impulses from\\nother neurons. The more electric impulse comes in, the higher the voltage. If the\\nvoltage exceeds a certain threshold, the neuron will ﬁre. This means that it unloads\\nits store, in that it sends a spike over the axon and the synapses. The electrical\\ncurrent divides and reaches many other neurons over the synapses, in which the\\nsame process takes place.\\nNow the question of the structure of the neural network arises. Each of the\\nroughly 10\\n11 neurons in the brain is connected to roughly 1000 to 10 000 other\\nneurons, which yields a total of over 10 14 connections. If we further consider that\\nthis gigantic number of extremely thin connections is made up of soft,\\nthree-dimensional tissue and that experiments on human brains are not easy to carry\\nout, then it becomes clear why we do not have a detailed circuit diagram of the\\nFig. 9.1 Two stages of the\\nmodeling of a neural network.\\nAbove a biological model and\\nbelow a formal model with\\nneurons and directed\\nconnections between them\\n246 9 Neural Networks'),\n",

Presumably we will never be capable of completely understanding the circuit\\ndiagram of our brain, based solely on its immense size.\\nFrom today ’s perspective, it is no longer worth even trying to make a complete\\ncircuit diagram of the brain, because the structure of the brain is adaptive.\\nIt changes itself on the ﬂy and adapts according to the individual ’s activities and\\nenvironmental in ﬂuences. The central role here is played by the synapses, which\\ncreate the connection between neurons. At the connection point between two\\nneurons, it is as if two cables meet. However, the two leads are not perfectly\\nconductively connective, rather there is a small gap, which the electrons cannot\\ndirectly jump over. This gap is ﬁlled with chemical substances, so-called neuro-\\ntransmitters. These can be ionized by an applied voltage and then transport a charge\\nover the gap. The conductivity of this gap depends on many parameters, for\\nexample the concentration and the chemical composition of the neurotransmitter.\\nIt is enlightening that the function of the brain reacts very sensitively to changes of\\nthis synaptic connection, for example through the in ﬂuence of alcohol or\\nother drugs.\\nHow does learning work in such a neural network? The surprising thing here is\\nthat it is not the actual active units, namely the neurons, which are adaptive, rather it\\nis the connections between them, that is, the synapses. Speci ﬁcally, this can change\\ntheir conductivity. We know that a synapse is made stronger by however much\\nmore electrical current it must carry. Stronger here means that the synapse has a\\nhigher conductivity. Synapses which are used often obtain an increasingly higher\\nweight. For synapses which are used infrequently or are not active at all, the\\nconductivity continues to decrease. This can even lead to them dying off.\\nAll neurons in the brain work asynchronously and in parallel, but, compared to a\\ncomputer, at very low speed. The time for a neural impulse takes about a millisecond,\\nexactly the same as the time for the ions to be transported over the synaptic gap. The\\nclock frequency of the neuron then is under one kilohertz and is thus lower than that\\nof modern computers by a factor of 10\\n6. This disadvantage, however, is more than\\ncompensated for in many complex cognitive tasks, such as image recognition, by the\\nvery high degree of parallel processing in the network of nerve cells.\\nThe connection to the outside world comes about through sensor neurons, for\\nexample on the retina in the eyes, or through nerve cells with very long axons\\nwhich reach from the brain to the muscles and thus can carry out actions such as the\\nmovement of a leg.\\nHowever, it is still unclear how the principles discussed make intelligent\\nbehavior possible.

It is not possible for a neuron to weaken or even\\ndie according to this rule. This can be modeled, for example, by a decay constant\\nwhich weakens an unused weight by a constant factor per time step, such as 0.99.\\nThis problem is solved quite differently by the model presented by Hop ﬁeld in\\n1982 [Hop82].

Patterns can be stored in\\nauto-associative memory. To call up a saved pattern, it is suf ﬁcient to provide a\\nsimilar pattern. The store then ﬁnds the most similar saved pattern.

Annealing is a\\nprocess of heat treating metals with the goal of making the metal stronger and\\nmore “stable”.\\nThe Hopﬁeld model carries out a search for a minimum of the energy function in\\nthe space of activation values.

For example, a\\ntelephone book is a mapping from the set of all entered names to the set of all\\ntelephone numbers. This mapping is implemented as a simple table, typically saved\\nin a database.\\nAccess control to a building using facial recognition is a similar task. Here we\\ncould also use a database in which a photo of every person is saved together with\\nthe person ’s name and possibly other data. The camera at the entrance then takes a\\npicture of the person and searches the database for an identical photo. If the photo is\\nfound, then the person is identi ﬁed and gets access to the building. However, a\\nbuilding with such a control system would not get many visitors because the\\nprobability that the current photo matches the saved photo exactly is very small.\\nIn this case it is not enough to just save the photo in a table. Rather, what we\\nwant is associative memory , which is capable of not only assigning the right name\\nto the photo, but also to any of a potentially in ﬁnite set of “similar” photos.\\nA function for ﬁnding similarity should be generated from a ﬁnite set of training\\ndata, namely the saved photos labeled with the names.

The network is split into two parts, similar to the feedforward network\\nshown schematically in Fig. 9.26. After a preprocessing layer there are several\\nlayers which are pre-trained by unsupervised learning (UL). Each layer in this UL\\nnetwork represents features of the input pattern. The lower the layer, the simpler the\\nfeatures.

However,\\nthere is still far too little known about how neural networks work in nature that\\nleads to a signi ﬁcant bene ﬁt in deep learning [GBC16].\\nAttached to the UL network is a classical supervised learning (SL) network,\\nwhich can be trained with backpropagation or RProp. Thus the learning process\\nworks as follows:\\n1. Unsupervised training of all feature layer weights.\\n2. Supervised training of the SL network with gradient descent.\\nThe unsupervised learning of the weights to the feature layers remains to be\\nexplained. By learning these weights, the features will be extracted.

One could\\ntherefore see feature extraction as a form of compression. We now outline one of\\nthe many possible algorithms for feature learning.\\n9.7.2 Stacked Denoising Autoencoder\\nThe feature layer ’s weights are determined by a fundamentally simple and obvi-\\nous algorithm called stacked denoising autoencoder [VLL+10], as shown in\\nFig. 9.27.\\nTo train the ﬁrst hidden layer, an autoencoder is trained with a supervised\\nlearning method, for example RProp. Its job is to learn the identity mapping of all\\ninput vectors x onto itself. The feature layer acts as the hidden layer. To make sure\\nthat features form in this layer, it is important to avoid over ﬁtting. The classical\\napproach would be to use cross-validation over the number of hidden neurons in the\\nfeature layer. That would lead to a small number of hidden neurons and thus few\\nfeatures. It has been shown that such a compressed encoding of the features is not\\noptimal. So-called sparse coding leads to better results.\\ncopy of input layer\\nfeature layer\\ninput layer\\ndecoder\\nencoder\\n.....\\n.....\\n.....\\nFig. 9.27 Autoencoder for learning the weights of a feature layer.

The distance\\njjy /C0 xjj\\nof the calculated output vector y from the original input vector x is used as the error\\nfunction for the weight change. Thus the encoder is trained to become robust against\\nnoise. During learning, a variable parameter weights the noisi ﬁed neurons more\\nstrongly than the others, so as to optimize the desired effect of the noise on learning.\\nAfter the autoencoder is trained, the actually unneeded decoder layer, i.e. the\\nsecond layer of weights, is removed. The ﬁrst layer is frozen and used to calculate the\\nfeatures in the UL network in Fig. 9.26 on page 278. Then, with this ﬁxed ﬁrst layer\\nof weights, the second feature layer is trained with the autoencoder algorithm,\\nfrozen, and so on until the last feature layer. Thus the unsupervised part of the\\nlearning is ﬁnished.\\nNow the SL portion of the network is trained with a classical supervised learning\\nalgorithm. For each training example, the output of of the UL network, i.e., the last\\nfeature layer is used as input, and a particular data label is the target output. During\\nbackpropagation, the weights of the feature layers can be trained again for the\\npurpose of ﬁne-tuning, or they can be left unchanged.\\nWe have not yet mentioned the preprocessing step, which differs depending on\\nthe application. Often all of the input variables are normalized. For photos, the pixel\\nimage is often transformed into a lower dimensional space, similar to PCA, using a\\nprocess called whitening, with the goal of making the generated features less\\nredundant. Here one could also directly use PCA.\\n9.7.3 Other Methods\\nIn addition to the stacked denoising autoencoder, the previously mentioned con-\\nvolutional neural networks play an important role. To reduce complexity and save\\ntime, the feature layers are not fully connected, rather each feature neuron retains\\ninput from only a few neurons in the layer below. The layers also alternate between\\nconvolution and pooling layers. In each convolution layer, a trainable linear ﬁlter is\\nused on the input neurons, and in the pooling layer, an average, maximum or a more\\ncomplex function is calculated from the input neurons.\\nAlso quite popular are deep belief networks, which use restricted Boltzmann\\nmachines for learning [HOT06].\\nDiscovery of features with UL networks can be completely replaced by clus-\\ntering, in which, for every discovered cluster, a binary feature determines whether a\\npoint belongs to that particular cluster. One can also use kernel PCA, a nonlinear\\ngeneralization of PCA, to learn features. As mentioned earlier, the fully connected\\nSL network can also be replaced by other learning algorithms, for instance by a\\nsupport vector machine.\\n280 9 Neural Networks'),\n",

The cause of the long computation times is the size of the input\\nlayer and the high number of layers in the network. This effect is ampli ﬁed further\\nif, in the case of a large input layer, the training data are elements of a\\nhigh-dimensional vector space. To represent the trained classes well, a great many\\ndata vectors are needed, which makes the computation time even longer.\\nThis means that a training run can take from minutes up to even days. In\\naddition, the system parameters of the complex networks have to be con ﬁgured,\\nwhich, in turn, has a big impact on the quality of the results. As we know from\\nChap. 8, optimal metaparameters for a learning algorithm can be found with\\ncross-validation, that is by trying out all combinations of values. Due to the\\ncomplexity of deep learning algorithms, there are many parameters, and the set of\\nparameter combinations grows exponentially with the number of parameters.\\nTherefore, the naive application of cross-validation is not practical. Instead, algo-\\nrithms are used which look for a point in the space of the system ’s metaparameters\\nthat minimizes errors on the validation data [BBBK11]. Examples of such meta-\\nparameters are the number of layers in the UL network as well as the SL network,\\nthe number of neurons in the individual layers, the learning rates, and the degree of\\ninterconnectedness for CNN networks. The algorithms for optimization of meta-\\nparameters use, for example, random search or gradient descent in the space of\\nmetaparameters [MDA15].\\nThus, for high-dimensional data sets, simple PCs are overwhelmed. Today one\\nworks with multiprocessor machines and the learning algorithms are run highly\\nparallel on modern graphics cards, which ultimately leads to training times of hours\\nto weeks for training with hyper parameter optimization.\\nThirty-eight different freely available software systems are listed at http://\\ndeeplearning.net/software_links.\\n7 Theano, with special support for graphics cards,\\nand the systems Pylearn2 und Keras, which are based on Theano, are especially\\ninteresting.

Predicate logic, which allows\\nformalization of relationships, is especially expressive and elegant. For example, a\\npredicate grandmother(katrin, klaus) is easy to understand. This type of\\nrelationship can also be learned with neural networks. However, it is not possible to\\nlocate the “grandmother neuron”in the network.

In supervised learning, the agent is\\nsupposed to learn a mapping from the input variables to the output variables. Here it\\nis important that for each individual training example, all values for both input\\nvariables and output variables are provided. In other words, we need a teacher or a\\ndatabase in which the mapping to be learned is approximately de ﬁned for a suf ﬁ-\\ncient number of input values. The sole task of the machine learning algorithm is to\\nﬁlter out the noise from the data and ﬁnd a function which approximates the\\nmapping well, even between the given data points.\\nIn reinforcement learning the situation is different and more dif ﬁcult because no\\ntraining data is available. We begin with a simple illustrative example from\\nrobotics, which then is used as an application for the various algorithms.\\nReinforcement learning is very valuable in the ﬁeld of robotics, where the tasks\\nto be performed are frequently complex enough to defy encoding as programs and\\nno training data is available. The robot ’s task consists of ﬁnding out, through trial\\nand error (or success), which actions are good in a certain situation and which are\\nnot. In many cases we humans learn in a very similar way. For example, when a\\nchild learns to walk, this usually happens without instruction, rather simply through\\nreinforcement. Successful attempts at walking are rewarded by forward progress,\\nand unsuccessful attempts are penalized by often painful falls. Positive and negative\\nreinforcement are also important factors in successful learning in school and in\\nmany sports (see Fig. 10.1 on page 290).\\nA greatly simpli ﬁed movement task is learned in the following example.\\nExample 10.1 A robot whose mechanism consists only of a rectangular block and\\nan arm with two joints g\\ny and gx is shown in Fig. 10.2 on page 290 (see [KMK97]).\\nThe robot’s only possible actions are the movement of gy up or down and of gx right\\nor left.

Since the\\ndirect reward for almost all actions is zero, it cannot be used as a heuristic evalu-\\nation function.\\nThe computational cost rises even higher when we consider that (in addition to\\nenumerating all policies), the value V\\np (s) must be calculated for every generated\\npolicy p and every starting state s.

This\\nmeans that the reaction of the environment to the action a in state s at two different\\npoints in time can result in different successor states and rewards. Such a nondeter-\\nministic Markov process is modeled by a probabilistic transition function d(s, a) and\\nprobabilistic immediate reward r(s, a).

Unfortunately there is no guarantee of convergence for Q-learning in\\nthe nondeterministic case if we proceed as before according to ( 10.12) on page 301.\\nThis is because, in successive runs through the outer loop of the algorithm in\\nFig. 10.11 on page 301, the reward and successor state can be completely different\\nfor the same state s and same action a. This may result in an alternating sequence\\nwhich jumps back and forth between several values.

Thus no learning\\ntakes place.\\n10.7 Exploration and Exploitation\\nFor Q-learning so far, only a coarse algorithm schema has been given. Especially\\nlacking is a description of the choice of the starting state each time and the actions\\nto be carried out in the inner loop of Fig. 10.11 on page 301. For the selection of\\nthe next action there are two possibilities. Among the possible actions, one can be\\nchosen randomly. In the long term this results in a uniform exploration of all\\npossible actions or policies, but with very slow convergence. An alternative to this\\nis the exploitation of previously learned ^Q values. Here the agent always chooses\\nthe action with the highest ^Q value. This results in relatively fast convergence of a\\nspeciﬁc trajectory. Other paths, however, remain unvisited all the way to the end. In\\nthe extreme case then we can obtain non-optimal policies. In Theorem 10.1 on\\npage 301 it is therefore required that every state-action pair is visited in ﬁnitely\\nmany times. It is recommended to use a combination of exploration and exploita-\\ntion with a high exploration portion at the beginning and reduce it more and more\\nover time.\\nThe choice of the starting state also in ﬂuences the speed of learning. In the ﬁrst\\nthree pictures in Fig. 10.12 on page 302 we can clearly see that, for the ﬁrst\\niterations, only the Q values in the immediate vicinity of state-action pairs are\\nchanged by immediate reward.

This is only possible when working with a ﬁnite state space with ﬁnitely\\nmany actions. If the state space is in ﬁnite, however, for example in the case of\\ncontinuous variables, then it is neither possible to save all Q values nor to visit all\\nstate-action pairs during learning.\\nNonetheless there is a simple way of using Q-learning and value iteration on\\ncontinuous variables. The Q(s, a) table is replaced by a neural network, for example\\na backpropagation network with the input variables s, a and the Q value as the\\ntarget output. For every update of a Q value, the neural network is presented a\\ntraining example with ( s, a) as input and Q(s, a) as target output. At the end we\\nhave a ﬁnite representation of the function Q(s, a). Since we only ever have ﬁnitely\\nmany training examples, but the function Q(s, a)i sd e ﬁned for in ﬁnitely many\\ninputs, we thus automatically obtain a generalization if the network size is chosen\\nappropriately (see Chap. 9). Instead of a neural network, we can also use another\\nsupervised learning algorithm or a function approximator such as a support vector\\nmachine or a Gaussian process.\\nHowever, the step from ﬁnitely many training examples to a continuous function\\ncan become very expensive in certain situations. Q-learning with function\\napproximation might not converge because Theorem 10.1 on page 301 is only true\\nif each state-action pair is visited in ﬁnitely often.\\nHowever, convergence problems can also come up in the case of ﬁnitely many\\nstate-action pairs when Q-learning is used on a POMDP. Q-learning can be\\napplied—in both described variants —to deterministic and nondeterministic Markov\\nprocesses (MDPs). For a POMDP it can happen that the agent, due to noisy sensors\\nfor example, perceives many different states as one. Often many states in the real\\nworld are purposefully mapped to one so-called observation. The resulting obser-\\nvation space is then much smaller than the state space, whereby learning becomes\\nfaster and over ﬁtting can be avoided (see Sect. 8.4.7).\\nHowever, by bundling together multiple states, the agent can no longer differ-\\nentiate between the actual states, and an action may lead it into many different\\nsuccessor states, depending on which state it is really in. This can lead to con-\\nvergence problems for value iteration or for Q-learning. In the literature (e.g.,\\nin [SB98]) many different approaches to a solution are suggested.\\nAlso very promising are so-called policy improvement methods and their\\nderived policy gradient methods, in which Q values are not changed, but rather the\\npolicy is changed directly. In this scheme a policy is searched for in the space of all\\npolicies, which maximizes the cumulative discounted reward ((10.1 ) on page 292).\\nOne possibility of achieving this is by following the gradient of the cumulative\\nreward to a maximum. The policy found in this way then clearly optimizes the\\ncumulative reward. In [PS08] it is shown that this algorithm can greatly speed up\\nlearning in applications with large state spaces, such as those which occur for\\nhumanoid robots.\\n10.8 Approximation, Generalization and Convergence 305'),\n",

From a large number of examples of this, we will brie ﬂy present a small\\nselection.\\nTD-learning, together with a backpropagation network with 40 to 80 hidden\\nneurons was used very successfully in TD-gammon, a backgammon-playing pro-\\ngram [Tes95]. The only immediate reward for the program is the result at the end of\\nthe game. An optimized version of the program with a two-move lookahead was\\ntrained against itself in 1.5 million games. It went on to defeat world-class players\\nand plays as well as the three best human players.\\nThere are many applications in robotics. For example, in the RoboCup Soccer\\nSimulation League, the best robot soccer teams now successfully use reinforcement\\nlearning [SSK05, Robb]. Balancing a pole, which is relatively easy for a human,\\nhas been solved successfully many times with reinforcement learning.\\nAn impressive demonstration of the learning ability of robots was given by Russ\\nTedrake at IROS 2008 in his presentation about a model airplane which learns to\\nland at an exact point, just like a bird landing on a branch [Ted08]. Because air\\ncurrents become very turbulent during such highly dynamic landing approach, the\\nassociated differential equation, the Navier –Stokes equation, is unsolvable. Landing\\ntherefore cannot be controlled in the classical mathematical way. Tedrake ’s com-\\nment about this:\\n“Birds don ’t solve Navier –Stokes!”\\nBirds can clearly learn to ﬂy and land even without the Navier –Stokes equation.\\nTedrake showed that this is now also possible for airplanes.\\nToday it is also possible to learn to control a real car in only 20 minutes using\\nQ-learning and function approximation [RMD07]. This example shows that real\\nindustrial applications in which few measurements must be mapped to actions can\\nbe learned very well in short time.\\nReal robots still have dif ﬁculty learning in high-dimensional state-action spaces\\nbecause, compared to a simulation, real robots get feedback from the environment\\nrelatively slowly. Due to time limitations, the many millions of necessary training\\ncycles are therefore not realizable. Here, besides fast learning algorithms, methods\\nare needed which allow at least parts of the learning to happen of ﬂine, that is,\\nwithout feedback from the environment.\\n10.10 AlphaGo, the Breakthrough in Go\\nAlthough alpha-beta pruning has been used successfully by chess computers, it\\ncannot achieve the same success in Go programs due to the game ’s large branching\\nfactor of roughly 250, as was described in Sect. 6.6.2.

Yet all prior attempts had not been very\\nsuccessful. This changed when Google DeepMind presented AlphaGo in\\n[SHM\\nþ16]. This program uses Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) to generate\\ntraining data, deep learning to evaluate board positions and reinforcement learning\\nto improve its strategy by playing against itself. Roughly sketched, the algorithm\\nworks as follows:\\nThe learning process ’s most important goal is to learn a policy p which, for a\\nposition s, calculates the probability p(a|s) of winning for every possible move a.I f\\nthis probability function is found, then it will be used in the game such that when in\\na position s, the best of all possible moves\\na\\n/C3 ¼ argmax\\na\\npa jsðÞ\\nwill be chosen. Because the program should play better than its human role model\\nin the end, it is a multi-stage process to learn a policy p that is as good as possible.\\nFirst, using saved champion-level games, two different move selection functions are\\nlearned (stage 1). The stronger of the two will then be further improved using\\nreinforcement learning (stage 2) and transformed into a position evaluation function\\n(stage 3). Finally, the program plays by combining the resulting position evaluation\\nfunction with the two move selection policies from stage 1 in a complex MCTS\\nsearch process.\\nStage 1: Deep Learning Based on Saved Games The KGS Go Server contains\\nmany complete Go matches by champion players with a total of thirty million board\\npositions s and the players ’ respective moves a(s). All of these moves are used to\\ntrain a convolutional neural network (CNN).\\nThe CNN takes a board position s as input and, after training, should return the\\nprobability p\\nrðajsÞ for all legal moves a. The de facto realization of prðajsÞ is a\\n19 /C2 19 matrix, which represents the board. The values for each of the 361 points\\non the board stand for the probability of winning for the corresponding move. An\\nexample for the application of such a policy function can be seen in Fig. 10.13 on\\npage 308. For the board state s left, p\\nrðajsÞ is represented in a density graph on the\\nright. On this turn, the player may set a white stone on one of the points. For nearly\\nall of the available points, the probability of winning is zero, but for a few inter-\\nesting points, the probability is represented as a grayscale value. Apparently the\\nmost desirable place to put the stone is in the top middle in row 2, column 11.\\nDuring training, the 19 /C2 19 board state for each of the thirty million champion\\nmoves in the database is given as input to the network, and the target output is the\\n19 /C2 19 matrix with all values set to null and the square selected by the expert\\nset to one.\\nOn a holdout set of test data it has not yet seen, the complex thirteen-layer CNN\\nnetwork used by AlphaGo chooses the correct move up to 57% of the time, which\\ndemonstrates an impressive gain over the best performance to date of about 44% by\\nother Go programs.\\n10.10 AlphaGo, the Breakthrough in Go 307'),\n",

This problem is known as the “curse of\\ndimensionality”.\\nIn the search for solutions to this problem, scientists observe animals and\\nhumans during learning. Here we notice that learning in nature takes place on many\\nlevels of abstraction. A baby ﬁrst learns simple motor and language skills on the\\nlowest level. When these are well learned, they are saved and can later be called up\\nany time and used. Translated into the language of computer science, this means\\nthat every learned ability is encapsulated in a module and then, on a higher level,\\nrepresents an action. By using such complex actions on a higher level, the action\\nspace becomes greatly reduced and thus learning is accelerated. In a similar way,\\nstates can be abstracted and thus the state space can be shrunk. This learning on\\nmultiple levels is called hierarchical learning [BM03].\\nAnother approach to modularization of learning is distributed learning, or\\nmulti-agent learning [PL05]. When learning a humanoid robot ’s motor skills, up to\\n50 different motors must be simultaneously controlled, which results in\\n50-dimensional state space and also a 50-dimensional action space. To reduce this\\ngigantic complexity, central control is replaced by distributed control. For example,\\neach individual motor could get an individual control which steers it directly, if\\npossible independently of the other motors. In nature, we ﬁnd this kind of control in\\ninsects. For example, the many legs of a millipede are not steered by a central brain,\\nrather each pair of legs has its own tiny “brain”.\\nSimilar to uninformed combinatorial search, reinforcement learning has the task\\nof ﬁnding the best of a huge number of policies. The learning task becomes sig-\\nniﬁcantly easier if the agent has a more or less good policy before learning begins.\\nThen the high-dimensional learning tasks can be solved sooner. But how do we ﬁnd\\nsuch an initial policy? Here there are two main possibilities.\\nThe ﬁrst possibility is classical programming. The programmer provides the\\nagent with a policy comprising a program which he considers good. Then a\\nswitchover occurs, for example to Q-learning. The agent chooses, at least at the\\nbeginning of learning, its actions according to the programmed policy and thus is\\nled into “interesting” areas of the state-action space. This can lead to dramatic\\nreductions in the search space of reinforcement learning.\\nIf traditional programming becomes too complex, we can begin training the\\nrobot or agent by having a human proscribe the right actions. In the simplest case,\\nthis is done by manual remote-control of the robot. The robot then saves the\\nproscribed action for each state and generalizes using a supervised learning algo-\\nrithm such as backpropagation or decision tree learning. This so-called demon-\\nstration learning [BCDS08, SE10] thus also provides an initial policy for the\\nsubsequent reinforcement learning.\\n10.11 Curse of Dimensionality 309'),\n",

The task for the human trainer or developer, however, is still\\ndemanding for complex applications. There are namely many possibilities for how\\nto structure the training of a robot and it will not be successful without experi-\\nmentation. This experimentation can be very tedious in practice because each new\\nlearning project must be designed and programmed. Tools are needed here which,\\nbesides the various learning algorithms, also offer the trainer the ability to combine\\nthese with traditional programming and demonstration learning. One of the ﬁrst of\\nthis kind of tool is the Teaching-Box [ESCT09], which in addition to an extensive\\nprogram library also offers templates for the con ﬁguration of learning projects and\\nfor communication between the robot and the environment. For example, the\\nhuman teacher can give the robot further feedback from the keyboard or through a\\nspeech interface in addition to feedback from the environment.\\nReinforcement learning is a fascinating and active area of research that will be\\nincreasingly used in the future. More and more robot control systems, but also other\\nprograms, will learn through feedback from the environment. Today there exist a\\nmultitude of variations of the presented algorithms and also completely different\\nalgorithms. The scaling problem remains unsolved. For small action and state\\nspaces with few degrees of freedom, impressive results can be achieved. If the\\nnumber of degrees of freedom in the state space grows to 18, for example for a\\nsimple humanoid robot, then learning becomes very expensive.\\nFor further foundational lectures, we recommend the compact introduction into\\nreinforcement learning in Tom Mitchell ’s book [Mit97].

What does this mean for AI?\\nExercise 1.4 If a problem is NP-complete or can be described as “hard”, that\\nmeans that there are instances in which the problem cannot be solved in an\\nacceptable amount of time. This is the so-called worst case . In some applications\\nwe have to live with the fact that in the worst case an ef ﬁcient solution is impos-\\nsible. This means that even in the future there will be practically relevant problems\\nwhich in certain special cases are unsolvable.\\nAI will therefore neither ﬁnd a universal formula, nor build a super machine\\nwith which all problems become solvable. It gives itself rather the task of building\\nsystems with a higher probability of ﬁnding a solution, or with a higher probability\\nof ﬁnding fast, optimal solutions. We humans in everyday life deal with subop-\\ntimal solutions quite well. The reason is, quite simply, the excessive cost of\\nﬁnding the optimal solution. For example, it only takes me seven minutes to ﬁnd\\nmy way from point A to point B with a map in an unfamiliar city. The shortest\\npath would have taken only six minutes. Finding the shortest path, however,\\nwould have taken perhaps an hour. The proof of the optimality of the path might\\nbe even costlier.\\nExercise 1.5\\n(a) The output depends not only on the input, but also on the contents of the\\nmemory. For an input x, depending on the contents of the memory, the output\\ncould be y\\n1 or y2.

Here are just a few commonplace examples: \\n• Google search\\n• Voice recognition (Siri, Alexa, Cortana, again Google)\\n• Netflix or Amazon predictive analytics as to purchases\\n• Navigation apps like Waze (owned by Google), Google Maps, MapQuest (yes,\\nremember this one?)\\n• Modern video games: Super Mario Bros., NBA 2K (my son's favorite), Call of\\nDuty, etc.\\n• Fraud detection\\n• Translation software\\nB\\nehind all of this technology is a complex set of algorithms, central processing units \\n(CPUs), and computer servers with increasing levels of sophistication that are \\ndesigned to accelerate that input and output of information, increasing the quality, \\ncomplexity, and volume of interactions with our devices, and enhance our quality of \\nlife. \\nWe are already living in the world of AI. Read the resources below in order to engage \\nthe past, present, and future of this world from a variety of perspectives. \\nS\\no, what comes next? Where are we headed with AI, and what level of responsibility do the designers and providers \\nhave with managing AI technology? Will we control AI technology or will it control us?

Artificial intelligence is science fiction. Artificial intelligence is already part of our \\neveryday lives. All those statements are true, it just depends on what flavor of AI you are referring to. \\nFor example, when Google DeepMind’s AlphaGo program defeated South Korean Master Lee Se-dol in the board game \\nGo earlier this year, the terms AI, machine learning, and were used in the media to describe how DeepMind won. And all \\nthree are part of the reason why AlphaGo trounced Lee Se-Dol. But they are not the same things. \\nThe easiest way to think of their relationship is to visualize them as concentric circles with AI — the idea that came first \\n— the largest, then machine learning — which blossomed later, and finally deep learning — which is driving today’s AI \\nexplosion —  fitting inside both. \\nFrom Bust to Boom \\nAI has been part of our imaginations and simmering in research labs since a handful of computer scientists rallied \\naround the term at the Dartmouth Conferences in 1956 and birthed the field of AI. In the decades since, AI has \\nalternately been heralded as the key to our civilization’s brightest future, and tossed on technology’s trash heap as a \\nharebrained notion of over-reaching propeller heads. Frankly, until 2012, it was a bit of both. \\nOver the past few years AI has exploded, and especially since 2015. Much of that has to do with the wide availability \\nof GPUs that make parallel processing ever faster, cheaper, and more powerful. It also has to do with the \\nsimultaneous one-two punch of practically infinite storage and a flood of data of every stripe (that whole Big Data \\nmovement) – images, text, transactions, mapping data, you name it. \\nLet’s walk through how computer scientists have moved from something of a bust — until 2012 — to a boom that has \\nunleashed applications used by hundreds of millions of people every day. \\nArtificial Intelligence—Human Intelligence Exhibited by Machines \\nKing me: computer programs that played checkers were among the earliest examples of artificial intelligence, stirring an \\nearly wave of excitement in the 1950s. \\nBack in that summer of ’56 conference the dream of those AI pioneers was to construct complex machines — enabled \\nby emerging computers — that possessed the same characteristics of human intelligence. This is the concept we think \\nof as “General AI” — fabulous machines that have all our senses (maybe even more), all our reason, and think just like \\nwe do. You’ve seen these machines endlessly in movies as friend — C-3PO — and foe — The Terminator. General AI \\nmachines have remained in the movies and science fiction novels for good reason; we can’t pull it off, at least not yet. \\nWhat we can do falls into the concept of “Narrow AI.” Technologies that are able to perform specific tasks as well as, or \\nbetter than, we humans can. Examples of narrow AI are things such as image classification on a service like Pinterest \\nand face recognition on Facebook. \\nThose are examples of Narrow AI in practice. These technologies exhibit some facets of human intelligence. But how? \\nWhere does that intelligence come from? That get us to the next circle, Machine Learning. '),\n",

So rather than hand-coding software routines with a specific \\nset of instructions to accomplish a particular task, the machine is “trained” using large amounts of data and algorithms \\nthat give it the ability to learn how to perform the task. \\nMachine learning came directly from minds of the early AI crowd, and the algorithmic approaches over the years \\nincluded decision tree learning, inductive logic programming, clustering, reinforcement learning, and Bayesian networks \\namong others. As we know, none achieved the ultimate goal of General AI, and even Narrow AI was mostly out of reach \\nwith early machine learning approaches. \\nAs it turned out, one of the very best application areas for machine learning for many years was computer vision, though \\nit still required a great deal of hand-coding to get the job done. People would go in and write hand-coded classifiers like \\nedge detection filters so the program could identify where an object started and stopped; shape detection to determine \\nif it had eight sides; a classifier to recognize the letters “S-T-O-P.” From all those hand-coded classifiers they would \\ndevelop algorithms to make sense of the image and “learn” to determine whether it was a stop sign. \\nGood, but not mind-bendingly great. Especially on a foggy day when the sign isn’t perfectly visible, or a tree obscures \\npart of it. There’s a reason computer vision and image detection didn’t come close to rivaling humans until very recently, \\nit was too brittle and too prone to error. Time, and the right learning algorithms made all the difference. \\n \\nDeep Learning — A Technique for Implementing Machine Learning \\nHerding cats: Picking images of cats out of YouTube videos was one of the first breakthrough demonstrations of deep \\nlearning. \\nAnother algorithmic approach from the early machine-learning crowd, Artificial Neural Networks, came and mostly went \\nover the decades. Neural Networks are inspired by our understanding of the biology of our brains – all those \\ninterconnections between the neurons. But, unlike a biological brain where any neuron can connect to any other neuron \\nwithin a certain physical distance, these artificial neural networks have discrete layers, connections, and directions of \\ndata propagation. \\n \\nYou might, for example, take an image, chop it up into a bunch of tiles that are inputted into the first layer of the neural \\nnetwork. In the first layer individual neurons, then passes the data to a second layer. The second layer of neurons does \\nits task, and so on, until the final layer and the final output is produced. \\nEach neuron assigns a weighting to its input — how correct or incorrect it is relative to the task being performed. The \\nfinal output is then determined by the total of those weightings. So think of our stop sign example. Attributes of a stop \\nsign image are chopped up and “examined” by the neurons — its octagonal shape, its fire-engine red color, its \\ndistinctive letters, its traffic-sign size, and its motion or lack thereof. The neural network’s task is to conclude whether \\nthis is a stop sign or not. It comes up with a “probability vector,” really a highly educated guess, based on the weighting. \\nIn our example the system might be 86% confident the image is a stop sign, 7% confident it’s a speed limit sign, and 5% \\nit’s a kite stuck in a tree, and so on — and the network architecture then tells the neural network whether it is right or \\nnot. \\nEven this example is getting ahead of itself, because until recently neural networks were all but shunned by the AI \\nresearch community. They had been around since the earliest days of AI, and had produced very little in the way of \\n“intelligence.” The problem was even the most basic neural networks were very computationally intensive, it just wasn’t '),\n",

Still, a small heretical research group led by Geoffrey Hinton at the University of Toronto kept at it, \\nfinally parallelizing the algorithms for supercomputers to run and proving the concept, but it wasn’t until GPUs were \\ndeployed in the effort that the promise was realized. \\nIf we go back again to our stop sign example, chances are very good that as the network is getting tuned or “trained” \\nit’s coming up with wrong answers —  a lot. What it needs is training. It needs to see hundreds of thousands, even \\nmillions of images, until the weightings of the neuron inputs are tuned so precisely that it gets the answer right \\npractically every time — fog or no fog, sun or rain. It’s at that point that the neural network has taught itself what a stop \\nsign looks like; or your mother’s face in the case of Facebook; or a cat, which is what Andrew Ng did in 2012 at Google. \\nNg’s breakthrough was to take these neural networks, and essentially make them huge, increase the layers and the \\nneurons, and then run massive amounts of data through the system to train it. In Ng’s case it was images from 10 million \\nYouTube videos. Ng put the “deep” in deep learning, which describes all the layers in these neural networks. \\nToday, image recognition by machines trained via deep learning in some scenarios is better than humans, and that \\nranges from cats to identifying indicators for cancer in blood and tumors in MRI scans. Google’s AlphaGo learned the \\ngame, and trained for its Go match — it tuned its neural network — by playing against itself over and over and over. \\n \\nThanks to Deep Learning, AI Has a Bright Future \\n \\nDeep Learning has enabled many practical applications of Machine Learning and by extension the overall field of AI. \\nDeep Learning breaks down tasks in ways that makes all kinds of machine assists seem possible, even likely. Driverless \\ncars, better preventive healthcare, even better movie recommendations, are all here today or on the horizon. AI is the \\npresent and the future. With Deep Learning’s help, AI may even get to that science fiction state we’ve so long imagined. \\nYou have a C-3PO, I’ll take it. You can keep your Terminator. \\n \\nNext Steps: How is AI Impacting Society? \\n \\nRabbinic Artificial Intelligence? Babylonian Talmud; Sanhedrin 65b \\nRava says: If the righteous wish to do so, they can create a world, as it is stated: “But your iniquities have \\nseparated between you and your God.” In other words, there is no distinction between God and a righteous person who \\nhas no sins, and just as God created the world, so can the righteous. \\nIndeed, Rava created a man, a golem, using forces of sanctity. Rava sent his creation before Rabbi Zeira. Rabbi \\nZeira would speak to him but he would not reply. Rabbi Zeira said to him: You were created by one of the members \\nof the group, one of the Sages. Return to your dust. \\n \\nHow Judaism Predicted the First Humanoid Robot, Mark Goldfeder, CNN \\n(CNN) - To the team of researchers, Eugene Goostman seemed like a nice Jewish boy from Odessa, Ukraine. \\nIn fact, he was a computer. \\nIn convincing some of the researchers that Goostman was real, the computer program became the first to pass the Turing \\nTest for artificial intelligence.  The Turing Test, named for British mathematician Alan Turing, is often thought of as the \\nbenchmark test for true machine intelligence. Since 1950, thousands of scientific teams have tried to create something \\ncapable of passing, but none has succeeded. That is, until Saturday –  and, appropriately for the Goostman advance, our \\nbrave new world can learn a bit from Jewish history. '),\n",

What makes this so fascinating is that  long ago Judaism \\ncame up with a test for humanity that was quite similar to the Turing Test. Jewish law ascribes to and develops several \\n“descriptive” tests for humanity - for instance \"born of woman\" (that is, a biological test).  But it also recognizes t he \\nlimitations of letting a technicality be the only definition of moral personhood. \\nIf there was a creature that looked human, and acted human, but was somehow not born of woman, Jewish law would \\nnot feel comfortable denying its basic human rights. And so  the Jerusalem Talmud developed a secondary test for \\nhumanity, a contextual/functional test.  In the fourth century collection of teachings, rabbis argue that if something looks \\nhuman and acts human enough that when interacting with it we are not sure, the creature should be considered a \\nperson, at least for some things.  Having human features is important under Jewish law because Judaism believes that \\nman is created in the image of God. \\nBut what exactly does it mean to act human? \\nMany of the early biblical c ommentators say that what separates man from animals is the ability to speak - not only to \\ncommunicate but also to express some level of moral intelligence.  While the early rabbis obviously didn’t have bots or \\ncomputer programs, they did deal with creatures that were human-ish, if not human.  \\nFamously, the rabbis give partial human status to something called a yadua. While the rabbinic descriptions are terse, the \\ncreature seems something like Bigfoot; a giant man-like animal usually spotted in the field.  Maimonides, in describing \\nthese creatures, notes that their speech is similar to humans, but is unintelligible.  The famous Jewish scholar refers to the \\ncreatures in his commentary as monkeys. But he doesn\\'t dispute the Talmudic teaching that in some cases ya dua can be \\nconsidered persons. After all, so the argument goes, the yadua looks (somewhat) like a human, and exhibits a level of \\nintelligence that makes it seem, in some ways human.  Therefore it deserves to be treated like a human for some things, \\neven though it fails the biological test of being born of a woman. \\nSimply put: The rule is that if something looks and acts human in a particular context, to the point that it seems like a \\nperson, do not start poking it to see if it bleeds. Just go ahead and treat it like a person. \\nWhere then, does that leave computers, or more specifically, human-like robots? \\nWhat if Eugene Goostman had been put into a life-like robotic body that had some human features? \\nThe golem in Jewish lore is typically depicted as a man-shap ed creature made of clay, imbued with a sense of life by \\nmeans of a specific series of letters programmed into it by a specialist.  It is quite similar, in fact, to the robot: a man-\\nshaped creature made of metal, imbued with a sense of life by means of a very specific series of numbers programmed \\ninto it by a specialist. Interestingly, the term “robot” (from the Czech word “robota” meaning “drudgery” or “hard work”) \\nwas invented by the Czech novelist and playwright Karel Capek. Capek lived in Prague, and was  well acquainted with the \\nwell-known legend of the Golem of Prague. Golems are usually associated with kabbalah (Jewish mysticism), but not \\nalways. \\nLest you think that golems are not a good analogy for robots because of a special supernatural status, some influential \\nJewish scholars claim that the most famous golem was created by natural science and was not magic at all.  The Talmud in \\nSanhedrin tells the story of how one rabbi created an artificial man and sent him to a colleague.  \\n“Rava created a man and sent him to Rabbi Zeira. The rabbi spoke to the man but he did not answer. Then he (Zeira) said: \\n\"You are from my colleagues. Return to your dust.”  Why was Zeira allowed to dismantle Rava\\'s golem, i.e. to return it to \\nits dust? Why was this not considered m urder? Because he talked to it, and it could not answer. That is, it could not pass \\nfor human. Which leaves open the possibility that another, better, golem, perhaps a 13 -year-old boy from Odessa, given \\nthe proper outfit, might have fared better. \\n '),\n",

As a science-fiction writer, it’s my duty to warn the human race that the robot revolution has begun —  even \\nif no one has noticed yet. \\nWhen a few autonomous test cars appeared on the roads over the last few years, we didn’t think of them as robots \\nbecause they didn’t have the humanoid shape that science-fiction movies taught us to expect. In 2016, they were \\nadopted widely: as buses in the United Arab Emirates and the Netherlands, taxis in Singapore and private cars in the \\nUnited States and China. There was a fatal accident in Florida involving an autonomous car, which caused some \\nconcerns, but this did not significantly affect our embrace of this technology. \\nInstead of arming ourselves against this alien presence, as some of my fellow science-fiction writers have fearfully \\nsuggested, we gawked as the vehicles pulled up to the curb. The driverless vehicles, some of which had no steering \\nwheels or gas pedals, merged into traffic and stopped at stop signs, smoothly taking us to our destinations. We lounged \\nin comfort, occasionally taking selfies. \\nMachine learning has been an important tool for autonomous car companies as they develop the systems that pilot \\ntheir vehicles. Instead of rigidly following programming as an app on your phone does, an A.I. system can try to learn to \\ndo a task itself, using techniques borrowed from human learning, like pattern recognition and trial and error, and may \\nuse hardware modeled on the architecture of a human brain. Currently, the responsibilities of artificial intelligence are \\nmostly limited to tasks like translating texts, helping with medical diagnoses and writing simple articles for media \\ncompanies. But we can expect to see unimaginable progress in this field in future — and the widespread use of the \\nautonomous car is going to accelerate that process as automobile and technology companies invest ever more \\nresources in its development. \\nLet’s try to envision that future. As during every other technological revolution, the robots will first transform our \\neconomy. People who drive for a living will lose their jobs — around 3 million in the United States alone. E-commerce \\nmay experience further booms because of automation, and car ownership is likely to become nearly obsolete as more \\ntargeted car sharing and public transportation systems are developed. Eventually, the robot cars could be integrated \\nwith other transportation systems. Say that you live in New York City and want to go to China’s Henan Province: You will \\nenter the address into an app, a car will take you to your plane at the airport, and after you land, another will take you \\ndirectly to your destination. \\nRobots will begin to creep into other areas of our lives — serving as busboys or waiters, for example — as our \\ninvestments in robotic transport improve their prowess in areas such as environmental detection and modeling, hyper- \\ncomplex problem solving and fuzzy-logic applications. With every advance, the use of A.I.-powered robots will expand \\ninto other fields: health care, policing, national defense and education. \\nThere will be scandals when things go wrong and backlash movements from the new Luddites. But I don’t think we’ll \\nprotest very much. The A.I. systems that drive our cars will teach us to trust machine intelligence over the human variety \\n— car accidents will become very rare, for example — and when given an opportunity to delegate a job to a robot, we \\nwill placidly do so without giving it much thought. \\nIn all previous technological revolutions, people who lost their jobs mostly moved to new ones, but that will be less likely \\nwhen the robots take over. A.I. that can learn from experience will replace many accountants, lawyers, bankers, \\ninsurance adjusters, doctors, scientific researchers and some creative professionals. Intelligence and advanced training \\nwill no longer mean job stability. '),\n",

When we’re no longer more intelligent than our \\nmachines, when they can easily outthink and outperform us, making the sort of intuitive leaps in research and other \\nareas that we currently associate with genius, a sort of learned helplessness is likely to set in for us, and the idea of work \\nitself may cease to hold meaning. \\nAs A.I. takes over, the remaining jobs may dwindle to a fraction of what they were, employing perhaps 10 percent or \\neven less of the total population. These may be highly creative or complex jobs that robots can’t do, such as senior \\nmanagement, directing scientific research or nursing and child care. \\nIn the dystopian scenario, as jobless numbers rise across the globe, our societies sink into prolonged turmoil. The world \\ncould be engulfed by endless conflicts between those who control the A.I. and the rest of us. The technocratic 10 \\npercent could end up living in a gated community with armed robot guards. \\nThere is a second, utopian scenario, where we’ve anticipated these changes and come up with solutions beforehand. \\nThose in political power have planned a smoother, gentler transition, perhaps using A.I. to help them anticipate and \\nmodulate the strife. At the end of it, almost all of us live on social welfare \\nHow we will spend our time is hard to predict. “He who does not work, neither shall he eat” has been the cornerstone of \\ncivilizations through the ages, but that will have vanished. History shows that those who haven’t had to work — \\naristocrats, say — have often spent their time entertaining and developing their artistic and sporting talents while \\nscrupulously observing elaborate rituals of dress and manners. \\nIn this future, creativity is highly valued. We sport ever more fantastic makeup, hairstyles and clothing. The labor of past \\nages seems barbaric. \\nBut the aristocrats ruled nations; in the A.I. era, machines are doing all the thinking. Because, over the decades, we’ve \\ngradually given up our autonomy, step by step, allowing ourselves to be transformed into A.I.’s docile, fabulously \\npampered pets. As A.I. whisks us from place to place — visits to family members, art galleries and musical events — we \\nwill look out the windows, as unaware of its plans for us as a poodle on its way to the groomer’s. \\n \\nThis isn’t crying wolf: Machines will take white-collar jobs during the next administration, Martin Ford, Linkedin \\n \\nIn this series, professionals provide advice for the next U.S. president.

That report, written by a prominent group of intellectuals that included two Nobel \\nlaureates, argued that the United States was on the brink of dramatic social and economic disruption as rapidly \\nadvancing industrial automation technology was poised to throw millions out of work. \\nNeedless to say, that dire prediction did not come to pass. However, there are good reasons to believe that technology \\nhas finally advanced to the point where such concerns need to be taken seriously. The fear that machines might \\ndisplace workers and create unemployment has a long history, and because the alarm has been prematurely sounded so \\nmany times in the past, there is a real danger that a “little boy who cried wolf” effect will leave us complacent and \\nunprepared if and when the disruption finally arrives. \\nRecent advances in artificial intelligence and robotics suggest that it is entirely possible that a significant impact on the \\njob market could begin to unfold during the course of your presidency. The most important thing to understand about all \\nthis progress is that computers no longer have to be programmed step-by-step. Machine learning—a technology that \\ninvolves smart algorithms churning through vast amounts of data—in effect allows computers figure out for themselves \\nhow to perform tasks or reach specific goals.

An increasing number of \\nnews articles published my major U.S. media companies are being generated autonomously by systems that analyze data \\nand create content that is often indistinguishable from a story written by a human journalist. Machine learning is also \\npowering the latest generation of robots, and the machines are rapidly becoming more flexible and dexterous. \\nAs technology continues to accelerate, the number and types of jobs that can be automated is certain to expand \\ndramatically. It's not just factory workers that can be replaced by robots and machines: Rapidly improving software \\nautomation and specialized artificial intelligence applications will make knowledge worker and professional occupations \\nrequiring college educations and advanced skills increasingly vulnerable. This demonstrated capability for information \\ntechnology to climb the skills ladder and threaten the jobs taken by college graduates is a special cause for concern \\nbecause it calls into question the only conventional solution we have to offer workers displaced by automation: ever \\nmore training and education. \\nIf technology eventually results in wide-spread unemployment, or if it drives down wages for the majority of workers as \\njobs are deskilled and commoditized, then we could also run into a serious problem with consumer demand. Jobs are \\nthe primary mechanism that gets purchasing power into the hands of consumers so that they buy the products and \\nservices generated by the economy. If automation has a negative impact on consumer demand and confidence, then we \\nrun the risk of economic stagnation or even a downward, deflationary spiral. \\nWhile these concerns may seem either far-fetched science fiction or a return to the Ludditism we’ve experienced in the \\npast, many of us in the technology community believe the risk is real--and that it deserves serious consideration. At a \\ntime when our political system is intensely polarized and seems unable to respond to even the most mundane \\nchallenges, the prospect of a dramatic and unanticipated economic and social disruption is not sometime we can afford \\nto take lightly. \\nIf the automation of jobs proves to be a relentless trend, then there will eventually be no alternative but to consider \\nunconventional solutions--perhaps including a guaranteed basic income for all Americans. Needless to say, the \\nimplementation of such policies would present a staggering political challenge. Given that there is no reliable way to \\npredict when the disruption will occur, or how fast it will unfold, it is imperative that planning begin well in advance. A \\nlogical first step would be to initiate some experimental pilot programs designed to test various policy responses. The \\ndata generated by these programs would be invaluable in eventually crafting an effective national policy to adapt our \\neconomy and society to the implications of disruptive technology. \\nI urge you to consider including among those who staff your new administration experts who are familiar with recent \\nadvances in artificial intelligence and robotics and with the potential economic and social impact of these technologies, \\nand who are prepared to initiate the planning process. \\n \\nThe Hype—and Hope—of Artificial Intelligence, Om Malik, The New Yorker \\nEarlier this month, on his HBO show “Last Week Tonight,” John Oliver skewered media companies’ desperate search for \\nclicks.

The only thing they all seem to agree on is \\nthat artificial intelligence is a set of technologies that try to imitate or augment human intelligence. To me, the \\nemphasis is on augmentation, in which intelligent software helps us interact and deal with the increasingly digital world \\nwe live in. \\nThree decades ago, I read newspapers, wrote on an electric typewriter, and watched a handful of television channels. \\nToday, I have streaming video from Netflix, Amazon, HBO, and other places, and I’m sometimes paralyzed by the \\nchoices. It is becoming harder for us to stay on top of the onslaught—e-mails, messages, appointments, alerts. \\nAugmented intelligence offers the possibility of winnowing an increasing number of inputs and options in a way that \\nhumans can’t manage without a helping hand. \\nComputers in general, and software in particular, are much more difficult than other kinds of technology for most \\npeople to grok, and they overwhelm us with a sense of mystery. There was a time when you would record a letter or a \\ndocument on a dictaphone and someone would transcribe it for you. A human was making the voice-to-text conversion \\nwith the help of a machine. Today, you can speak into your iPhone and it will transcribe your messages itself. If people \\ncould have seen our current voice-to-text capabilities fifty years ago, it would have looked as if technology had become \\nsentient. Now it’s just a routine way to augment how we interact with the world. Kevin Kelly, the writer and futurist, \\nwhose most recent book is “The Inevitable: Understanding the 12 Technological Forces That Will Shape Our Future,” \\nsaid, “What we can do now would be A.I. fifty years ago. What we can do in fifty years will not be called A.I.” \\nYou don’t have to look up from Facebook to get his point. Before we had the Internet, we would either call or write to \\nour friends, one at a time, and keep up with their lives. It was a slow process, and took a lot of effort and time to learn \\nabout each other. As a result, we had fewer interactions—there was a cost attached to making long-distance phone \\ncalls and a time commitment attached to writing letters. With the advent of the Internet, e-mail emerged as a way to \\nfacilitate and speed up those interactions. Facebook did one better—it turned your address book into a hub, allowing \\nyou to simultaneously stay in touch with hundreds, even thousands, of friends. The algorithm allows us to maintain \\nmore relationships with much less effort at almost no cost. \\nMichelle Zhou spent over a decade and a half at I.B.M. Research and I.B.M. Watson Group before leaving to become a \\nco-founder of Juji, a sentiment-analysis startup. An expert in a field where artificial intelligence and human-computer \\ninteraction intersect, Zhou breaks down A.I. into three stages. The first is recognition intelligence, in which algorithms \\nrunning on ever more powerful computers can recognize patterns and glean topics from blocks of text, or perhaps even \\nderive the meaning of a whole document from a few sentences. The second stage is cognitive intelligence, in which \\nmachines can go beyond pattern recognition and start making inferences from data. The third stage will be reached \\nonly when we can create virtual human beings, who can think, act, and behave as humans do. \\nWe are a long way from creating virtual human beings. Despite what you read in the media, no technology is perfect, \\nand the most valuable function of A.I. lies in augmenting human intelligence. To even reach that point, we need to train \\ncomputers to mimic humans. An April, 2016, story in Bloomberg Business provided a good example. It described how \\ncompanies that provide automated A.I. personal assistants (of the sort that arrange schedules or help with online \\nshopping) had hired human “trainers” to check and evaluate the A.I. assistants’ responses before they were sent \\nout. “It’s ironic that we define artificial intelligence with respect to its ability to replicate human intelligence,” said Sean \\nGourley, the founder of Primer, a data-analytics company, and an expert on deriving intelligence from large data sets \\nwith the help of algorithms. \\nWhether it is Spotify or Netflix or a new generation of A.I. chat bots, all of these tools rely on humans themselves to '),\n",

When we listen to songs, put them on playlists, and share them with others, we are sending vital \\nsignals to Spotify that train its algorithms not only to discover what we might like but also to predict hits. \\nEven the much talked-about “computer vision” has become effective only because humans have uploaded billions of \\nphotos and tagged them with metadata to give those photos context. Increasingly powerful computers can scan through \\nthese photos and find patterns and meaning. Similarly, Google can use billions of voice samples it has collected over the \\nyears to build a smart system that understands accents and nuances, which make its voice-based search function \\npossible. \\nUsing Zhou’s three stages as a yardstick, we are only in the “recognition intelligence” phase—today’s computers use \\ndeep learning to discover patterns faster and better. It’s true, however, that some companies are working on \\ntechnologies that can be used for inferring meanings, which would be the next step. “It does not matter whether we will \\nend up at stage 3,” Zhou wrote to me in an e-mail. “I’m still a big fan of man-machine symbiosis, where computers do \\nthe best they can (that is being consistent, objective, precise), and humans do our best (creative, imprecise but \\nadaptive).” For a few more decades, at least, humans will continue to train computers to mimic us. And, in the \\nmeantime, we’re going to have to deal with the hyperbole surrounding A.I. \\n \\nDeep Dive: What are the Next Frontiers and Further Implications of AI? \\n \\nDeepMind and Blizzard Open StarCraft II as an AI Research Environment, Oriyal VInyals, Stephen Gaffney, Timo Ewalds; \\nDeepMind \\nDeepMind's scientific mission is to push the boundaries of AI by developing systems that can learn to solve \\ncomplex problems. To do this, we design agents and test their ability in a wide range of environments from the \\npurpose- built DeepMind Lab to established games, such as Atari and Go. \\nTesting our agents in games that are not specifically designed for AI research, and where humans play well, is crucial \\nto benchmark agent performance. That is why we, along with our partner Blizzard Entertainment, are excited to \\nannounce the release of SC2LE, a set of tools that we hope will accelerate AI research in the real-time strategy game \\nStarCraft II. The SC2LE release includes: \\nA Machine Learning API developed by Blizzard that gives researchers and developers hooks into the game. This \\nincludes the release of tools for Linux for the first time. \\nA dataset of anonymised game replays, which will increase from 65k to more than half a million in the coming weeks. \\nAn open source version of DeepMind’s toolset, PySC2, to allow researchers to easily use Blizzard’s feature-layer API \\nwith their agents. \\nA series of simple RL mini-games to allow researchers to test the performance of agents on specific tasks. \\nA joint paper that outlines the environment, and reports initial baseline results on the mini-games, supervised \\nlearning from replays, and the full 1v1 ladder game against the built-in AI. \\nStarCraft and StarCraft II are among the biggest and most successful games of all time, with players competing in \\ntournaments for more than 20 years. The original game is also already used by AI and ML researchers, who compete \\nannually in the AIIDE bot competition. Part of StarCraft’s longevity is down to the rich, multi-layered gameplay, which \\nalso makes it an ideal environment for AI research. \\nFor example, while the objective of the game is to beat the opponent, the player must also carry out and balance a \\nnumber of sub-goals, such as gathering resources or building structures. In addition, a game can take from a few \"),\n",

Finally, \\nthe map is only partially observed, meaning agents must use a combination of memory and planning to succeed. \\nThe game also has other qualities that appeal to researchers, such as the large pool of avid players that compete \\nonline every day. This ensures that there is a large quantity of replay data to learn from - as well as a large quantity \\nof extremely talented opponents for AI agents. \\nEven StarCraft’s action space presents a challenge with a choice of more than 300 basic actions that can be \\ntaken. Contrast this with Atari games, which only have about 10 (e.g. up, down, left, right etc). On top of this, \\nactions in StarCraft are hierarchical, can be modified and augmented, with many of them requiring a point on the \\nscreen. Even assuming a small screen size of 84x84 there are roughly 100 million possible actions available. \\nThis release means researchers can now tackle some of these challenges using Blizzard’s own tools to build their own \\ntasks and models. \\nOur PySC2 environment wrapper helps by offering a flexible and easy-to-use interface for RL agents to play the game. In \\nthis initial release, we break the game down into “feature layers”, where elements of the  game such as unit type, health \\nand map visibility are isolated from each other, whilst preserving the core visual and spatial elements of the game. \\n \\nThe release also contains a series of ‘mini-games’ - an established technique for breaking down the game i nto \\nmanageable chunks that can be used to test agents on specific  tasks, such as moving the camera, collecting mineral \\nshards or selecting units. We hop e that researchers can test their techniques on these as well as propose new mini - \\ngames for other researchers to compete and evaluate on. \\n \\nOur initial investigations show that our agents perform well on these mini-games. But when it comes to the full game, \\neven strong baseline agents, such as A3C, cannot win a single game against even the easiest built-in AI. For instance, the \\nfollowing video shows an early-stage training agent (left) which fails to keep its workers mining, a task that humans find \\ntrivial. After training (right), the agents perform more meaningful actions, but if they are to be competitive, we will \\nneed further breakthroughs in deep RL and related areas. \\nOne technique that we know allows our agents to learn stronger policies is imitation learning. This kind of training will \\nsoon be far easier thanks to Blizzard, which has committed to ongoing releases of hundreds of thousands of anonymized \\nreplays gathered from the StarCraft II ladder. These will not only allow researchers to train supervised agents to play  \\nthe game, but also opens up other interesting areas of research such as sequence prediction and long-term memory. \\nOur hope is that the release of these new tools will build on the work that the AI community has already done in \\nStarCraft, encouraging more DeepRL research and making it easier for researchers to focus on the frontiers of our field. \\nWe look forward to seeing what the community discovers. \\n \\nNeuroscience-Inspired Artificial Intelligence, Demis Hassabis, Dharshan Kumaran, Christopher Summerfield, Matthew \\nBotvinick; Neuron \\nThe fields of neuroscience and artificial intelligence (AI) have a long and intertwined history.

However, more recently, the interaction has become much less commonplace, as both subjects have grown \\nenormously in complexity and disciplinary boundaries have solidified. In this review, we argue for the critical a nd \\nongoing importance of neuroscience in generating ideas that will accelerate and guide AI research (see Hassabis \\ncommentary in Brooks et al., 2012). \\nWe begin with the premise that building human-level general AI (or “Turing-powerful” intelligent systems; Turing, 1936) \\nis a daunting task, because the search space of possible solutions is vast and likely only very sparsely populated. We \\nargue that this therefore underscores the utility of scrutinizing the inner workings of the human brain— the only existing \\nproof that such an intelligence is even possible. Studying animal cognition and its neural implementation also has a vital \\nrole to play, as it can provide a window into various important aspects of higher-level general intelligence. \\nThe benefits to developing AI of closely examining biological intelligence are two-fold. First, neuroscience provides a \\nrich source of inspiration for new types of algorithms and architectures, independent of and complementary to the \\nmathematical and logic-based methods and ideas that have largely dominated traditional approaches to AI. For \\nexample, were a new facet of biological computation found to be critical to supporting a cognitive function, then we \\nwould consider it an excellent candidate for incorporation into artificial systems. Second, neuroscience can \\nprovide validation of AI techniques that already exist. If a known algorithm is subsequently found to be implemented in \\nthe brain, then that is strong support for its plausibility as an integral component of an overall general intelligence \\nsystem. Such clues can be critical to a long-term research program when determining where to allocate resources most \\nproductively. For example, if an algorithm is not quite attaining the level of performance required or expected, but we \\nobserve it is core to the functioning of the brain, then we can surmise that redoubled engineering efforts geared to \\nmaking it work in artificial systems are likely to pay off. \\nOf course from a practical standpoint of building an AI system, we need not slavishly enforce adherence to biological \\nplausibility. From an engineering perspective, what works is ultimately all that matters. For our purposes then, \\nbiological plausibility is a guide, not a strict requirement. What we are interested in is a systems neuroscience-level \\nunderstanding of the brain, namely the algorithms, architectures, functions, and representations it utilizes. This roughly \\ncorresponds to the top two levels of the three levels of analysis that Marr famously stated are required to understand \\nany complex biological system (Marr and Poggio, 1976): the goals of the system (the computational level) and the \\nprocess and computations that realize this goal (the algorithmic level). The precise mechanisms by which this is \\nphysically realized in a biological substrate are less relevant here (the implementation level). Note this is where our \\napproach to neuroscience-inspired AI differs from other initiatives, such as the Blue Brain Project (Markram, 2006) or \\nthe field of neuromorphic computing systems (Esser et al., 2016), which attempt to closely mimic or directly reverse \\nengineer the specifics of neural circuits (albeit with different goals in mind). By focusing on the computational and \\nalgorithmic levels, we gain transferrable insights into general mechanisms of brain function, while leaving room to \\naccommodate the distinctive opportunities and challenges that arise when building intelligent machines in silico. \\nThe following sections unpack these points by considering the past, present, and future of the AI -neuroscience \\ninterface. Before beginning, we offer a clarification. Throughout this article, we employ the terms “neuroscience” and \\n“AI.” We use these terms in the widest possible sense. When we say neuroscience, we mean to include all fields that a re \\ninvolved with the study of the brain, the behaviors that it generates, and the mechanisms by which it does so, including \\ncognitive neuroscience, systems neuroscience and psychology. When we say AI, we mean work in machine learning, \\nstatistics, and AI research that aims to build intelligent machines (Legg and Hutter, 2007). \\nWe begin by considering the origins of two fields that are pivotal for current AI research, deep learning and \\nreinforcement learning, both of which took root in ideas from neuroscience. We then turn to the current state of play \\nin AI research, noting many cases where inspiration has been drawn (sometimes without explicit acknowledgment) \\nfrom concepts and findings in neuroscience. In this section, we particularly emphasize instances where we have '),\n",

Next, we consider the potential for neuroscience to support future AI research, looking at \\nboth the most likely research challenges and some emerging neuroscience-inspired AI techniques. While our main focus \\nwill be on the potential for neuroscience to benefit AI, our final section will briefly consider ways in which AI may be \\nhelpful to neuroscience and the broader potential for synergistic interactions between these two fields. \\n \\nThe Past:  \\n \\nDeep Learning \\nAs detailed in a number of recent reviews, AI has been revolutionized over the past few years by dramatic advances in \\nneural network, or “deep learning,” methods (LeCun et al., 2015, Schmidhuber, 2014). As the moniker “neural network” \\nmight suggest, the origins of these AI methods lie directly in neuroscience. In the 1940s, investigations of neural \\ncomputation began with the construction of artificial neural networks that could compute logical functions (McCulloch \\nand Pitts, 1943). Not long after, others proposed mechanisms by which networks of neurons might learn incrementally \\nvia supervisory feedback (Rosenblatt, 1958) or efficiently encode environmental statistics in an unsupervised fashion \\n(Hebb, 1949). These mechanisms opened up the field of artificial neural network research, and they continue to provide \\nthe foundation for contemporary research on deep learning (Schmidhuber, 2014). \\nNot long after this pioneering work, the development of the backpropagation algorithm allowed learning to occur in \\nnetworks composed of multiple layers (Rumelhart et al., 1985, Werbos, 1974). Notably, the implications of this method \\nfor understanding intelligence, including AI, were first appreciated by a group of neuroscientists and cognitive scientists, \\nworking under the banner of parallel distributed processing (PDP) (Rumelhart et al., 1986). At the time, most AI research \\nwas focused on building logical processing systems based on serial computation, an approach inspired in part by the \\nnotion that human intelligence involves manipulation of symbolic representations (Haugeland, 1985). However, there \\nwas a growing sense in some quarters that purely symbolic approaches might be too brittle and inflexible to solve \\ncomplex real-world problems of the kind that humans routinely handle. Instead, a growing foundation of knowledge \\nabout the brain seemed to point in a very different direction, highlighting the role of stochastic and highly parallelized \\ninformation processing. Building on this, the PDP movement proposed that human cognition and behavior emerge from \\ndynamic, distributed interactions within networks of simple neuron-like processing units, interactions tuned by learning \\nprocedures that adjust system parameters in order to minimize error or maximize reward. \\nAlthough the PDP approach was at first applied to relatively small-scale problems, it showed striking success in \\naccounting for a wide range of human behaviors (Hinton et al., 1986). Along the way, PDP research introduced a diverse \\ncollection of ideas that have had a sustained influence on AI research. For example, current machine translation \\nresearch exploits the notion that words and sentences can be represented in a distributed fashion (i.e., as vectors) \\n(LeCun et al., 2015), a principle that was already ingrained in early PDP-inspired models of sentence processing (St. John \\nand McClelland, 1990). Building on the PDP movement’s appeal to biological computation, current state-of-the- \\nart convolutional neural networks (CNNs) incorporate several canonical hallmarks of neural computation, including \\nnonlinear transduction, divisive normalization, and maximum-based pooling of inputs (Yamins and DiCarlo, 2016). These \\noperations were directly inspired by single-cell recordings from the mammalian visual cortex that revealed how visual \\ninput is filtered and pooled in simple and complex cells in area V1 (Hubel and Wiesel, 1959). Moreover, current network \\narchitectures replicate the hierarchical organization of mammalian cortical systems, with both convergent and divergent \\ninformation flow in successive, nested processing layers (Krizhevsky et al., 2012, LeCun et al., 1989, Riesenhuber and \\nPoggio, 1999, Serre et al., 2007), following ideas first advanced in early neural network models of visual processing \\n(Fukushima, 1980). In both biological and artificial systems, successive non-linear computations transform raw visual \\ninput into an increasingly complex set of features, permitting object recognition that is invariant to transformations of \\npose, illumination, or scale.

During this period, it continued to draw key ideas from neuroscience. \\nFor example, biological considerations informed the development of successful regularization schemes that support \\ngeneralization beyond training data. One such scheme, in which only a subset of units participate in the processing of a \\ngiven training example (“dropout”), was motivated by the stochasticity that is inherent in biological systems populated \\nby neurons that fire with Poisson-like statistics (Hinton et al., 2012). Here and elsewhere, neuroscience has provided \\ninitial guidance toward architectural and algorithmic constraints that lead to successful neural network applications for \\nAI. \\n \\nReinforcement Learning \\nAlongside its important role in the development of deep learning, neuroscience was also instrumental in erecting a \\nsecond pillar of contemporary AI, stimulating the emergence of the field of reinforcement learning (RL). RL methods \\naddress the problem of how to maximize future reward by mapping states in the environment to actions and are among \\nthe most widely used tools in AI research (Sutton and Barto, 1998). Although it is not widely appreciated among AI \\nresearchers, RL methods were originally inspired by research into animal learning. In particular, the development of \\ntemporal-difference (TD) methods, a critical component of many RL models, was inextricably intertwined with research \\ninto animal behavior in conditioning experiments. TD methods are real-time models that learn from differences \\nbetween temporally successive predictions, rather than having to wait until the actual reward is delivered. Of particular \\nrelevance was an effect called second-order conditioning, where affective significance is conferred on a conditioned \\nstimulus (CS) through association with another CS rather than directly via association with the unconditioned stimulus \\n(Sutton and Barto, 1981). TD learning provides a natural explanation for second-order conditioning and indeed has gone \\non to explain a much wider range of findings from neuroscience, as we discuss below. \\nHere, as in the case of deep learning, investigations initially inspired by observations from neuroscience led to further \\ndevelopments that have strongly shaped the direction of AI research. From their neuroscience-informed origins, TD \\nmethods and related techniques have gone on to supply the core technology for recent advances in AI, ranging from \\nrobotic control (Hafner and Riedmiller, 2011) to expert play in backgammon (Tesauro, 1995) and Go (Silver et al., 2016). \\n \\nThe Present: \\nReading the contemporary AI literature, one gains the impression that the earlier engagement with neuroscience has \\ndiminished. However, if one scratches the surface, one can uncover many cases in which recent developments have \\nbeen inspired and guided by neuroscientific considerations. Here, we look at four specific examples. \\n \\nAttention \\nThe brain does not learn by implementing a single, global optimization principle within a uniform and undifferentiated \\nneural network (Marblestone et al., 2016). Rather, biological brains are modular, with distinct but interacting \\nsubsystems underpinning key functions such as memory, language, and cognitive control (Anderson et al., 2004, \\nShallice, 1988). This insight from neuroscience has been imported, often in an unspoken way, into many areas of current \\nAI. \\nOne illustrative example is recent AI work on attention. Up until quite lately, most CNN models worked directly on entire \\nimages or video frames, with equal priority given to all image pixels at the earliest stage of processing. The primate \\nvisual system works differently. Rather than processing all input in parallel, visual attention shifts strategically among \\nlocations and objects, centering processing resources and representational coordinates on a series of regions in turn \\n(Koch and Ullman, 1985, Moore and Zirnsak, 2017, Posner and Petersen, 1990). Detailed neurocomputational models \\nhave shown how this piecemeal approach benefits behavior, by prioritizing and isolating the information that is relevant '),\n",

As such, attentional mechanisms have been a \\nsource of inspiration for AI architectures that take “glimpses” of the input image at each step, update internal state \\nrepresentations, and then select the next location to sample (Larochelle and Hinton, 2010, Mnih et al., 2014) (Figure \\n1A). One such network was able to use this selective attentional mechanism to ignore irrelevant objects in a scene, \\nallowing it to perform well in challenging object classification tasks in the presence of clutter (Mnih et al., 2014). \\nFurther, the attentional mechanism allowed the computational cost (e.g., number of network parameters) to scale \\nfavorably with the size of the input image. Extensions of this approach were subsequently shown to produce impressive \\nperformance at difficult multi-object recognition tasks, outperforming conventional CNNs that process the entirety of \\nthe image, both in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency (Ba et al., 2015), as well as enhancing image-to-\\ncaption generation (Xu et al., 2015). \\nWhile attention is typically thought of as an orienting mechanism for perception, its “spotlight” can also be focused \\ninternally, toward the contents of memory. This idea, a recent focus in neuroscience studies (Summerfield et al., 2006), \\nhas also inspired work in AI. In some architectures, attentional mechanisms have been used to select information to be \\nread out from the internal memory of the network. This has helped provide recent successes in machine translation \\n(Bahdanau et al., 2014) and led to important advances on memory and reasoning tasks (Graves et al., 2016). These \\narchitectures offer a novel implementation of content-addressable retrieval, which was itself a concept originally \\nintroduced to AI from neuroscience (Hopfield, 1982). \\nOne further area of AI where attention mechanisms have recently proven useful focuses on generative models, \\nsystems that learn to synthesize or “imagine” images (or other kinds of data) that mimic the structure of examples \\npresented during training. Deep generative models (i.e., generative models implemented as multi-layered neural \\nnetworks) have recently shown striking successes in producing synthetic outputs that capture the form and structure of \\nreal visual scenes via the incorporation of attention-like mechanisms (Hong et al., 2015, Reed et al., 2016). For \\nexample, in one state-of-the-art generative model known as DRAW, attention allows the system to build up an image \\nincrementally, attending to one portion of a “mental canvas” at a time (Gregor et al., 2015). \\n \\nEpisodic Memory \\nA canonical theme in neuroscience is that that intelligent behavior relies on multiple memory systems (Tulving, 1985). \\nThese will include not only reinforcement-based mechanisms, which allow the value of stimuli and actions to be learned \\nincrementally and through repeated experience, but also instance-based mechanisms, which allow experiences to be \\nencoded rapidly (in “one shot”) in a content-addressable store (Gallistel and King, 2009). The latter form of memory, \\nknown as episodic memory (Tulving, 2002), is most often associated with circuits in the medial temporal lobe, \\nprominently including the hippocampus (Squire et al., 2004). \\nOne recent breakthrough in AI has been the successful integration of RL with deep learning (Mnih et al., 2015, Silver \\net al., 2016). For example, the deep Q-network (DQN) exhibits expert play on Atari 2600 video games by learning to \\ntransform a vector of image pixels into a policy for selecting actions (e.g., joystick movements). One key ingredient in \\nDQN is “experience replay,” whereby the network stores a subset of the training data in an instance-based way, and \\nthen “replays” it offline, learning anew from successes or failures that occurred in the past. Experience replay is critical \\nto maximizing data efficiency, avoids the destabilizing effects of learning from consecutive correlated experiences, and \\nallows the net work to learn a viable value function even in complex, highly structured sequential environments such \\nas video games. \\nCritically, experience replay was directly inspired by theories that seek to understand how the multiple memory systems \\nin the mammalian brain might interact. According to a prominent view, animal learning is supported by parallel or \\n“complementary” learning systems in the hippocampus and neocortex (Kumaran et al., 2016, McClelland et al., 1995). \\nThe hippocampus acts to encode novel information after a single exposure (one-shot learning), but this information is \\ngradually consolidated to the neocortex in sleep or resting periods that are interleaved with periods of activity. This '),\n",

This theory was originally proposed as a solution to the well-known problem that in \\nconventional neural networks, correlated exposure to sequential task settings leads to mutual interference among \\npolicies, resulting in catastrophic forgetting of one task as a new one is learned. The replay buffer in DQN might thus be \\nthought of as a very primitive hippocampus, permitting complementary learning in silico much as is proposed for \\nbiological brains. Later work showed that the benefits of experience replay in DQN are enhanced when replay of highly \\nrewarding events is prioritized (Schaul et al., 2015), just as hippocampal replay seems to favor events that lead to high \\nlevels of reinforcement (Singer and Frank, 2009). \\n \\nExperiences stored in a memory buffer can not only be used to gradually adjust the parameters of a deep network \\ntoward an optimal policy, as in DQN, but can also support rapid behavioral change based on an individual experience. \\nIndeed, theoretical neuroscience has argued for the potential benefits of episodic control, whereby rewarded action \\nsequences can be internally re-enacted from a rapidly updateable memory store, implemented in the biological case in \\nthe hippocampus (Gershman and Daw, 2017). Further, normative accounts show that episodic control is particularly \\nadvantageous over other learning mechanisms when limited experience of the environment has been obtained (Lengyel \\nand Dayan, 2007). \\nRecent AI research has drawn on these ideas to overcome the slow learning characteristics of deep RL networks, \\ndeveloping architectures that implement episodic control (Blundell et al., 2016). These networks store specific \\nexperiences (e.g., actions and reward outcomes associated with particular Atari game screens) and select new actions \\nbased on the similarity between the current situation input and the previous events stored in memory, taking the \\nreward associated with those previous events into account (Figure 1B). As predicted from the initial, neuroscience-\\nbased work (Lengyel and Dayan, 2007), artificial agents employing episodic control show striking gains in performance \\nover deep RL networks, particularly early on during learning (Blundell et al., 2016). Further, they are able to achieve \\nsuccess on tasks that depend heavily on one-shot learning, where typical deep RL architectures fail. Moreover, episodic-\\nlike memory systems more generally have shown considerable promise in allowing new concepts to be learned rapidly \\nbased on only a few examples (Vinyals et al., 2016). In the future, it will be interesting to harness the benefits of rapid \\nepisodic-like memory and more traditional incremental learning in architectures that incorporate both of these \\ncomponents within an interacting framework that mirrors the complementary learning systems in mammalian brain. \\nWe discuss these future perspectives below in more detail later, in “Imagination and planning.” \\n \\nWorking Memory \\nHuman intelligence is characterized by a remarkable ability to maintain and manipulate information within an active \\nstore, known as working memory, which is thought to be instantiated within the prefrontal cortex and interconnected \\nareas (Goldman-Rakic, 1990). Classic cognitive theories suggest that this functionality depends on interactions between \\na central controller (“executive”) and separate, domain-specific memory buffers (e.g., visuo-spatial sketchpad) \\n(Baddeley, 2012). AI research has drawn inspiration from these models, by building architectures that explicitly maintain \\ninformation over time. Historically, such efforts began with the introduction of recurrent neural network architectures \\ndisplaying attractor dynamics and rich sequential behavior, work directly inspired by neuroscience (Elman, \\n1990, Hopfield and Tank, 1986, Jordan, 1997). This work enabled later, more detailed modeling of human working \\nmemory (Botvinick and Plaut, 2006, Durstewitz et al., 2000), but it also laid the foundation for further technical \\ninnovations that have proved pivotal in recent AI research. In particular, one can see close parallels between the \\nlearning dynamics in these early, neuroscience-inspired networks and those in long-short-term memory (LSTM) \\nnetworks, which subsequently achieved state of the art performance across a variety of domains. LTSMs allow \\ninformation to be gated into a fixed activity state and maintained until an appropriate output is required (Hochreiter \\nand Schmidhuber, 1997). Variants of this type of network have shown some striking behaviors in challenging domains, \\nsuch as learning to respond to queries about the latent state of variables after training on computer code (Zaremba and '),\n",

This \\ncontrasts with classic models of human working memory, which, as mentioned above, separate these two. This \\nneuroscience-based schema has recently inspired more complex AI architectures where control and storage are \\nsupported by distinct modules (Graves et al., 2014, Graves et al., 2016, Weston et al., 2014). For example, the \\ndifferential neural computer (DNC) involves a neural network controller that attends to and reads/writes from an \\nexternal memory matrix (Graves et al., 2016). This externalization allows the network controller to learn from scratch \\n(i.e., via end-to-end optimization) to perform a wide range of complex memory and reasoning tasks that currently elude \\nLSTMs, such as finding the shortest path through a graph-like structure, such as a subway map, or manipulating blocks in \\na variant of the Tower of Hanoi task (Figure 1C). These types of problems were previously argued to depend exclusively \\non symbol processing and variable binding and therefore beyond the purview of neural networks (Fodor and Pylyshyn, \\n1988, Marcus, 1998). Of note, although both LSTMs and the DNC are described here in the context of working memory, \\nthey have the potential to maintain information over many thousands of training cycles and so may thus be suited to \\nlonger-term forms of memory, such as retaining and understanding the contents of a book. \\n \\nContinual Learning \\nIntelligent agents must be able to learn and remember many different tasks that are encountered over multiple \\ntimescales. Both biological and artificial agents must thus have a capacity for continual learning, that is, an ability to \\nmaster new tasks without forgetting how to perform prior tasks (Thrun and Mitchell, 1995). While animals appear \\nrelatively adept at continual learning, neural networks suffer from the problem of catastrophic forgetting (French, \\n1999, McClelland et al., 1995). This occurs as the network parameters shift toward the optimal state for performing the \\nsecond of two successive tasks, overwriting the configuration that allowed them to perform the first. Given the \\nimportance of continual learning, this liability of neural networks remains a significant challenge for the development \\nof AI. \\nIn neuroscience, advanced neuroimaging techniques (e.g., two-photon imaging) now allow dynamic in vivo visualization \\nof the structure and function of dendritic spines during learning, at the spatial scale of single synapses (Nishiyama and \\nYasuda, 2015). This approach can be used to study neocortical plasticity during continual learning (Cichon and Gan, \\n2015, Hayashi-Takagi et al., 2015, Yang et al., 2009). There is emerging evidence for specialized mechanisms that \\nprotect knowledge about previous tasks from interference during learning on a new task. These include decreased \\nsynaptic lability (i.e., lower rates of plasticity) in a proportion of strengthened synapses, mediated by enlargements to \\ndendritic spines that persist despite learning of other tasks (Cichon and Gan, 2015, Yang et al., 2009) (Figure 1D). These \\nchanges are associated with retention of task performance over several months, and indeed, if they are “erased” with \\nsynaptic optogenetics, this leads to forgetting of the task (Hayashi-Takagi et al., 2015). These empirical insights are \\nconsistent with theoretical models that suggest that memories can be protected from interference through synapses \\nthat transition between a cascade of states with different levels of plasticity (Fusi et al., 2005) (Figure 1D). \\nTogether, these findings from neuroscience have inspired the development of AI algorithms that address the challenge \\nof continual learning in deep networks by implementing of a form of “elastic” weight consolidation (EWC) (Kirkpatrick \\net al., 2017), which acts by slowing down learning in a subset of network weights identified as important to previous \\ntasks, thereby anchoring these parameters to previously found solutions (Figure 1D). This allows multiple tasks to be \\niearned without an increase in network capacity, with weights shared efficiently between tasks with related structure. \\nIn this way, the EWC algorithm allows deep RL networks to support continual learning at large scale. \\n \\nThe Future: \\nIn AI, the pace of recent research has been remarkable.

Machines can autonomously generate synthetic \\nnatural images and simulations of human speech that are almost indistinguishable from their real-world counterparts \\n(Lake et al., 2015, van den Oord et al., 2016), translate between multiple languages (Wu et al., 2016), and create “neural \\nart” in the style of well-known painters (Gatys et al., 2015). \\nHowever, much work is still needed to bridge the gap between machine and human-level intelligence. In working toward \\nclosing this gap, we believe ideas from neuroscience will become increasingly indispensable. In neuroscience, the advent \\nof new tools for brain imaging and genetic bioengineering have begun to offer a detailed characterization of the \\ncomputations occurring in neural circuits, promising a revolution in our understanding of mammalian brain function \\n(Deisseroth and Schnitzer, 2013). The relevance of neuroscience, both as a roadmap for the AI research agenda and as a \\nsource of computational tools is particularly salient in the following key areas. \\n \\nIntuitive Understanding of the Physical World \\nRecent perspectives emphasize key ingredients of human intelligence that are already well developed in human infants \\nbut lacking in most AI systems (Gilmore et al., 2007, Gopnik and Schulz, 2004, Lake et al., 2016). Among these \\ncapabilities are knowledge of core concepts relating to the physical world, such as space, number, and objectness, \\nwhich allow people to construct compositional mental models that can guide inference and prediction (Battaglia et al., \\n2013, Spelke and Kinzler, 2007). \\nAI research has begun to explore methods for addressing this challenge. For example, novel neural network \\narchitectures have been developed that interpret and reason about scenes in a humanlike way, by decomposing them \\ninto individual objects and their relations (Battaglia et al., 2016, Chang et al., 2016, Eslami et al., 2016) (Figures 2A and \\n2B ). In some cases, this has resulted in human-level performance on challenging reasoning tasks (Santoro et al., 2017). \\nIn other work, deep RL has been used to capture the processes by which children gain commonsense understanding of \\nthe world through interactive experiments (Denil et al., 2016). Relatedly, deep generative models have been developed \\nthat are able to construct rich object models from raw sensory inputs (Higgins et al., 2016). These leverage constraints \\nfirst identified in neuroscience, such as redundancy reduction (Barlow, 1959), which encourage the emergence of \\ndisentangled representations of independent factors such as shape and position (Figure 2C). Importantly, the latent \\nrepresentations learned by such generative models exhibit compositional properties, supporting flexible transfer to \\nnovel tasks (Eslami et al., 2016, Higgins et al., 2016, Rezende et al., 2016a). In the caption associated with Figure 2, we \\nprovide more detailed information about these networks. \\nEfficient Learning \\nHuman cognition is distinguished by its ability to rapidly learn about new concepts from only a handful of examples, \\nleveraging prior knowledge to enable flexible inductive inferences. In order to highlight this human ability as a challenge \\nfor AI, Lake and colleagues recently posed a “characters challenge” (Lake et al., 2016). Here, an observer must \\ndistinguish novel instances of an unfamiliar handwritten character from other, similar items after viewing only a single \\nexemplar. Humans can perform this task well, but it is difficult for classical AI systems. \\nEncouragingly, recent AI algorithms have begun to make progress on tasks like the characters challenge, through both \\nstructured probabilistic models (Lake et al., 2015) and deep generative models based on the abovementioned DRAW \\nmodel (Rezende et al., 2016b). Both classes of system can make inferences about a new concept despite a poverty of \\ndata and generate new samples from a single example concept (Figure 2D). Further, recent AI research has developed \\nnetworks that “learn to learn,” acquiring knowledge on new tasks by leveraging prior experience with related problems, \\nto support one-shot concept learning (Santoro et al., 2016, Vinyals et al., 2016) and accelerating learning in RL tasks \\n(Wang et al., 2016). Once again, this builds on concepts from neuroscience: learning to learn was first explored in studies \\nof animal learning (Harlow, 1949), and has subsequently been studied in developmental psychology (Adolph, '),\n",
              " Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/future of A.I intelligence.pdf', 'page': 19}, page_content='20 \\nYU Ideas - A Project of the Office of the President - Yeshiva University – yu.edu/yuideas  \\n2005, Kemp et al., 2010, Smith, 1995). \\nTransfer Learning \\nHumans also excel at generalizing or transferring generalized knowledge gained in one context to novel, previously \\nunseen domains (Barnett and Ceci, 2002, Holyoak and Thagard, 1997). For example, a human who can drive a car, use a \\nlaptop computer, or chair a committee meeting is usually able act effectively when confronted with an unfamiliar \\nvehicle, operating system, or social situation. Progress is being made in developing AI architectures capable of exhibiting \\nstrong generalization or transfer, for example by enabling zero-shot inferences about novel shapes outside the training \\ndistribution based on compositional representations (Higgins et al., 2016; Figure 2C). Others have shown that a new \\nclass of architecture, known as a progressive network, can leverage knowledge gained in one video game to learn \\nrapidly in another, promising the sort of “far transfer” that is characteristic of human skill acquisition (Rusu et al., 2016a). \\nProgressive networks have also been successfully employed to transfer knowledge for a simulated robotic environment \\nto a real robot arm, massively reducing the training time required on the real world (Rusu et al., 2016b). Intriguingly, the \\nproposed architecture bears some resemblance to a successful computational model of sequential task learning in \\nhumans (Collins and Koechlin, 2012, Donoso et al., 2014). In the neuroscience literature, one hallmark of transfer \\nlearning has been the ability to reason relationally, and AI researchers have also begun to make progress in building \\ndeep networks that address problems of this nature, for example by solving visual analogies (Reed et al., 2015). More \\ngenerally however, how humans or other animals achieve this sort of high-level transfer learning is unknown, and \\nremains a relatively unexplored topic in neuroscience. New advances on this front could provide critical insights to spur \\nAI research toward the goal of lifelong learning in agents, and we encourage neuroscientists to engage more deeply \\nwith this question. \\nAt the level of neural coding, this kind of transfer of abstract structured knowledge may rely on the formation of \\nconceptual representations that are invariant to the objects, individuals, or scene elements that populate a sensory \\ndomain but code instead for abstract, relational information among patterns of inputs (Doumas et al., 2008). However, \\nwe currently lack direct evidence for the existence of such codes in the mammalian brain. Nevertheless, one recent \\nreport made the very interesting claim that neural codes thought to be important in the representation of allocentric \\n(map-like) spaces might be critical for abstract reasoning in more general domains (Constantinescu et al., 2016). In the \\nmammalian entorhinal cortex, cells encode the geometry of allocentric space with a periodic “grid” code, with \\nreceptive fields that tile the local space in a hexagonal pattern (Rowland et al., 2016). Grid codes may be an excellent \\ncandidate for organizing conceptual knowledge, because they allow state spaces to be decomposed efficiently, in a \\nway that could support discovery of subgoals and hierarchical planning (Stachenfeld et al., 2014). Using functional \\nneuroimaging, the researchers provide evidence for the existence of such codes while humans performed an abstract \\ncategorization task, supporting the view that periodic encoding is a generalized hallmark of human knowledge \\norganization (Constantinescu et al., 2016). However, much further work is required to substantiate this interesting claim. \\n \\nImagination and Planning \\nDespite their strong performance on goal-directed tasks, deep RL systems such as DQN operate mostly in a reactive way, \\nlearning the mapping from perceptual inputs to actions that maximize future value. This “model-free” RL is \\ncomputationally inexpensive but suffers from two major drawbacks: it is relatively data inefficient, requiring large \\namounts of experience to derive accurate estimates, and it is inflexible, being insensitive to changes in the value of \\noutcomes (Daw et al., 2005). By contrast, humans can more flexibly select actions based on forecasts of long-term \\nfuture outcomes through simulation-based planning, which uses predictions generated from an internal model of the \\nenvironment learned through experience (Daw et al., 2005, Dolan and Dayan, 2013, Tolman, 1948). Moreover, planning \\nis not a uniquely human capacity. For example, when caching food, scrub jays consider the future conditions under \\nwhich it is likely to be recovered (Raby et al., 2007), and rats use a “cognitive map” when navigating, allowing inductive \\ninferences during wayfinding and facilitating one-shot learning behaviors in maze-like environments (Daw et al., '),\n",

Of course, this point has not been lost on AI researchers; indeed, early planning algorithms such as \\nDyna (Sutton, 1991) were inspired by theories that emphasized the importance of “mental models” in generating \\nhypothetical experiences useful for human learning (Craik, 1943). By now, a large volume of literature exists on AI \\nplanning techniques, including model-based RL methods, which seek to implement this forecast-based method of action \\nselection. Furthermore, simulation-based planning, particularly Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) methods, which use \\nforward search to update a value function and/or policy (Browne et al., 2012), played a key role in recent work in which \\ndeep RL attained expert-level performance in the game of Go (Silver et al., 2016). \\nAI research on planning, however, has yet to capture some of the key characteristics that give human planning abilities \\ntheir power. In particular, we suggest that a general solution to this problem will require understanding how rich \\ninternal models, which in practice will have to be approximate but sufficiently accurate to support planning, can be \\nlearned through experience, without strong priors being handcrafted into the network by the experimenter. We also \\nargue that AI research will benefit from a close reading of the related literature on how humans imagine possible \\nscenarios, envision the future, and carry out simulation-based planning, functions that depend on a common neural \\nsubstrate in the hippocampus (Doll et al., 2015, Hassabis and Maguire, 2007, Hassabis and Maguire, 2009, Schacter \\net al., 2012). Although imagination has an intrinsically subjective, unobservable quality, we have reason to believe that it \\nhas a conserved role in simulation-based planning across species (Hassabis and Maguire, 2009, Schacter et al., 2012). For \\nexample, when paused at a choice point, ripples of neural activity in the rat hippocampus resemble those observed \\nduring subsequent navigation of the available trajectories (“preplay”), as if the animal were “imagining” each possible \\nalternative (Johnson and Redish, 2007, Ólafsdóttir et al., 2015, Pfeiffer and Foster, 2013). Further, recent work has \\nsuggested a similar process during non-spatial planning in humans (Doll et al., 2015, Kurth-Nelson et al., 2016). We have \\ndiscussed above the ways in which the introduction of mechanisms that replay and learn offline from past experiences \\ncan improve the performance of deep RL agents such as DQN (as discussed above in Episodic Memory). \\nSome encouraging initial progress toward simulation-based planning has been made using deep generative models \\n(Eslami et al., 2016, Rezende et al., 2016a, Rezende et al., 2016b) (Figure 2). In particular, recent work has introduced \\nnew architectures that have the capacity to generate temporally consistent sequences of generated samples that reflect \\nthe geometric layout of newly experienced realistic environments (Gemici et al., 2017, Oh et al., 2015) (Figure 2E), \\nproviding a parallel to the function of the hippocampus in binding together multiple components to create an imagined \\nexperience that is spatially and temporally coherent (Hassabis and Maguire, 2007). Deep generative models thus show \\nthe potential to capture the rich dynamics of complex realistic environments, but using these models for simulation- \\nbased planning in agents remains a challenge for future work. \\nInsights from neuroscience may provide guidance that facilitates the integration of simulation with control. An emerging \\npicture from neuroscience research suggests that the hippocampus supports planning by instantiating an internal model \\nof the environment, with goal-contingent valuation of simulated outcomes occurring in areas downstream of the \\nhippocampus such the orbitofrontal cortex or striatum (Redish, 2016). Notably, however, the mechanisms that guide the \\nrolling forward of an internal model of the environment in the hippocampus remain uncertain and merit future scrutiny. \\nOne possibility is that this process is initiated by the prefrontal cortex through interactions with the hippocampus. \\nIndeed, this notion has distinct parallels with proposals from AI research that a separate controller interacts with an \\ninternal model of the environment in a bidirectional fashion, querying the model based on task-relevant goals and \\nreceiving predicted simulated states as input (Schmidhuber, 2014). Further, recent efforts to develop agents have \\nemployed architectures that instantiate a separation between controller and environmental model to effect simulation- \\nbased planning in problems involving the interaction between physical objects (Hamrick et al., 2017). \\nIn enhancing agent capabilities in simulation-based planning, it will also be important to consider other salient \\nproperties of this process in humans (Hassabis and Maguire, 2007, Hassabis and Maguire, 2009). Research into human \\nimagination emphasizes its constructive nature, with humans able to construct fictitious mental scenarios by \\nrecombining familiar elements in novel ways, necessitating compositional/disentangled representations of the form '),\n",

This fits well with \\nthe notion that planning in humans involves efficient representations that support generalization and transfer, so that \\nplans forged in one setting (e.g., going through a door to reach a room) can be leveraged in novel environments that \\nshare structure. Further, planning and mental simulation in humans are “jumpy,” bridging multiple temporal scales at a \\ntime; for example, humans seem to plan hierarchically, by considering in parallel terminal solutions, interim choice \\npoints, and piecemeal steps toward the goal (Balaguer et al., 2016, Solway et al., 2014, Huys et al., 2012). We think that \\nultimately these flexible, combinatorial aspects of planning will form a critical underpinning of what is perhaps the \\nhardest challenge for AI research: to build an agent that can plan hierarchically, is truly creative, and can generate \\nsolutions to challenges that currently elude even the human mind. \\n \\nVirtual Brain Analytics \\n \\nOne rather different way in which neuroscience may serve AI is by furnishing new analytic tools for understanding \\ncomputation in AI systems. Due to their complexity, the products of AI research often remain “black boxes”; we \\nunderstand only poorly the nature of the computations that occur, or representations that are formed, during learning \\nof complex tasks. However, by applying tools from neuroscience to AI systems, synthetic equivalents of single-cell \\nrecording, neuroimaging, and lesion techniques, we can gain insights into the key drivers of successful learning in AI \\nresearch and increase the interpretability of these systems. We call this “virtual brain analytics.” \\nRecent work has made some progress along these lines. For example, visualizing brain states through dimensionality \\nreduction is commonplace in neuroscience, and has recently been applied to neural networks (Zahavy et al., 2016). \\nReceptive field mapping, another standard tool in neuroscience, allows AI researchers to determine the response \\nproperties of units in a neural network. One interesting application of this approach in AI is known as activity \\nmaximization, in which a network learns to generate synthetic images by maximizing the activity of certain classes of \\nunit (Nguyen et al., 2016, Simonyan et al., 2013). Elsewhere, neuroscience-inspired analyses of linearized networks have \\nuncovered important principles that may be of general benefit in optimizing learning these networks, and \\nunderstanding the benefits of network depth and representational structure (McClelland and Rogers, 2003, Saxe et al., \\n2013). \\nWhile this initial progress is encouraging, more work is needed. It remains difficult to characterize the functioning of \\ncomplex architectures such as networks with external memory (Graves et al., 2016). Nevertheless, AI researchers are in \\nthe unique position of having ground truth knowledge of all components of the system, together with the potential to \\ncausally manipulate individual elements, an enviable scenario from the perspective of experimental neuroscientists. As \\nsuch, we encourage AI researchers to use approaches from neuroscience to explore properties of network \\narchitectures and agents through analysis, visualization, causal manipulation, not forgetting the need for carefully \\ndesigned hypothesis-driven experiments (Jonas and Kording, 2017, Krakauer et al., 2017). We think that virtual brain \\nanalytics is likely to be an increasingly integral part of the pipeline of algorithmic development as the complexity of \\narchitectures increases. \\n \\nFrom AI to Neuroscience \\nThus far, our review has focused primarily on the role of neuroscience in accelerating AI research rather than vice versa. \\nHistorically, however, the flow of information between neuroscience and AI has been reciprocal. Machine learning \\ntechniques have transformed the analysis of neuroimaging datasets—for example, in the multivariate analysis of fMRI \\nand magnetoencephalographic (MEG) data (Cichy et al., 2014, Çukur et al., 2013, Kriegeskorte and Kievit, 2013)—with \\npromise for expediting connectomic analysis (Glasser et al., 2016), among other techniques. Going further, we believe \\nthat building intelligent algorithms has the potential to offer new ideas about the underpinnings of intelligence in the \\nbrains of humans and other animals. In particular, psychologists and neuroscientists often have only quite vague notions '),\n",

AI research can help, by formalizing these concepts in a \\nquantitative language and offering insights into their necessity and sufficiency (or otherwise) for intelligent behavior. \\nA key illustration of this potential is provided by RL. After ideas from animal psychology helped to give birth to \\nreinforcement learning research, key concepts from the latter fed back to inform neuroscience. In particular, the profile \\nof neural signals observed in midbrain dopaminergic neurons in conditioning paradigms was found to bear a striking \\nresemblance to TD-generated prediction errors, providing neural evidence that the brain implements a form of TD \\nlearning (O’Doherty et al., 2003, Schultz et al., 1997). This overall narrative arc provides an excellent illustration of how \\nthe exchange of ideas between AI and neuroscience can create a “virtuous circle” advancing the objectives of both \\nfields. \\nIn another domain, work focused on enhancing the performance of CNNs has also yielded new insights into the nature \\nof neural representations in high-level visual areas (Khaligh-Razavi and Kriegeskorte, 2014, Yamins and DiCarlo, 2016). \\nFor example, one group systematically compared the ability of more than 30 network architectures from AI to explain \\nthe structure of neural representations observed in the ventral visual stream of humans and monkeys, finding favorable \\nevidence for deep supervised networks (Khaligh-Razavi and Kriegeskorte, 2014). Further, these deep convolutional \\nnetwork architectures offer a computational account of recent neurophysiological data demonstrating that the coding \\nof category-orthogonal properties of objects (e.g., position, size) actually increases as one progresses higher up the \\nventral visual stream (Hong et al., 2016). While these findings are far from definitive as yet, it shows how state-of-the-\\nart neural networks from AI can be used as plausible simulacra of biological brains, potentially providing detailed \\nexplanations of the computations occurring therein (Khaligh-Razavi and Kriegeskorte, 2014, Yamins and DiCarlo, 2016). \\nRelatedly, properties of the LSTM architecture have provided key insights that motivated the development of working \\nmemory models that afford gating-based maintenance of task-relevant information in the prefrontal cortex (Lloyd et al., \\n2012, O’Reilly and Frank, 2006). \\nWe also highlight two recent strands of AI research that may motivate new research in neuroscience. First, neural \\nnetworks with external memory typically allow the controller to iteratively query or “hop through” the contents of \\nmemory. This mechanism is critical for reasoning over multiple supporting input statements that relate to a particular \\nquery (Sukhbaatar et al., 2015). Previous proposals in neuroscience have argued for a similar mechanism in human \\ncognition, but any potential neural substrates, potentially in the hippocampus, remain to be described (Kumaran and \\nMcClelland, 2012). Second, recent work highlights the potential benefits of “meta-reinforcement learning,” where RL is \\nused to optimize the weights of a recurrent network such that the latter is able to implement a second, emergent RL \\nalgorithm that is able to learn faster than the original (Duan et al., 2016, Wang et al., 2016). Intriguingly, these ideas \\nconnect with a growing neuroscience literature indicating a role for the prefrontal cortex in RL, alongside more \\nestablished dopamine-based mechanisms (Schultz et al., 1997). Specifically, they indicate how a relatively slow-learning \\ndopaminergic RL algorithm may support the emergence of a freestanding RL algorithm instantiated with the recurrent \\nactivity dynamics of the prefrontal cortex (Tsutsui et al., 2016). \\nInsights from AI research are also providing novel perspectives on how the brain might implement an algorithmic \\nparallel to backpropagation, the key mechanism that allows weights within multiple layers of a hierarchical network to \\nbe optimized toward an objective function (Hinton et al., 1986, Werbos, 1974). Backpropagation offers a powerful \\nsolution to the problem of credit assignment within deep networks, allowing efficient representations to be learned \\nfrom high dimensional data (LeCun et al., 2015). However, until recently, several aspects of the backpropagation \\nalgorithm were viewed to be biologically implausible (e.g., see Bengio et al., 2015). One important factor is that \\nbackpropagation has typically been thought to require perfectly symmetric feedback and feedforward connectivity, a \\nprofile that is not observed in mammalian brains. Recent work, however, has demonstrated that this constraint can in \\nfact be relaxed (Liao et al., 2015, Lillicrap et al., 2016).

In contrast, plasticity in biological synapses depends primarily on local information \\n(i.e., pre- and post-synaptic neuronal activity) (Bi and Poo, 1998). AI research has begun to address this fundamental \\nissue. In particular, recent work has shown that hierarchical auto-encoder networks and energy-based networks (e.g., \\ncontinuous Hopfield networks) (Scellier and Bengio, 2016, Whittington and Bogacz, 2017)—models that have strong \\nconnections to theoretical neuroscience ideas about predictive coding (Bastos et al., 2012)—are capable of \\napproximating the backpropagation algorithm, based on weight updates that involve purely local information. Indeed, \\nconcrete connections have been drawn between learning in such networks and spike-timing dependent plasticity \\n(Scellier and Bengio, 2016), a Hebbian mechanism instantiated widely across the brain (Bi and Poo, 1998). A different \\nclass of local learning rule has been shown to allow hierarchical supervised networks to generate high-level invariances \\ncharacteristic of biological systems, including mirror-symmetric tuning to physically symmetric stimuli, such as faces \\n(Leibo et al., 2017). Taken together, recent AI research offers the promise of discovering mechanisms by which the brain \\nmay implement algorithms with the functionality of backpropagation. Moreover, these developments illustrate the \\npotential for synergistic interactions between AI and neuroscience: research aimed to develop biologically plausible \\nforms of backpropagation have also been motivated by the search for alternative learning algorithms. Given the \\nincreasingly deep networks (e.g., >20 layer) used in AI research, factors such as the compounding of successive non- \\nlinearities pose challenges for optimization using backpropagation (Bengio et al., 2015). \\n \\nConclusions \\nIn this perspective, we have reviewed some of the many ways in which neuroscience has made fundamental \\ncontributions to advancing AI research, and argued for its increasingly important relevance. In strategizing for the future \\nexchange between the two fields, it is important to appreciate that the past contributions of neuroscience to AI have \\nrarely involved a simple transfer of full-fledged solutions that could be directly re-implemented in machines. Rather, \\nneuroscience has typically been useful in a subtler way, stimulating algorithmic-level questions about facets of animal \\nlearning and intelligence of interest to AI researchers and providing initial leads toward relevant mechanisms. As such, \\nour view is that leveraging insights gained from neuroscience research will expedite progress in AI research, and this will \\nbe most effective if AI researchers actively initiate collaborations with neuroscientists to highlight key questions that \\ncould be addressed by empirical work. \\nThe successful transfer of insights gained from neuroscience to the development of AI algorithms is critically dependent \\non the interaction between researchers working in both these fields, with insights often developing through a continual \\nhanding back and forth of ideas between fields. In the future, we hope that greater collaboration between researchers \\nin neuroscience and AI, and the identification of a common language between the two fields (Marblestone et al., 2016), \\nwill permit a virtuous circle whereby research is accelerated through shared theoretical insights and common empirical \\nadvances. We believe that the quest to develop AI will ultimately also lead to a better understanding of our own minds \\nand thought processes. Distilling intelligence into an algorithmic construct and comparing it to the human brain might \\nyield insights into some of the deepest and the most enduring mysteries of the mind, such as the nature of creativity, \\ndreams, and perhaps one day, even consciousness. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n '),\n",

However, it is slightly\\nmore sophisticated than just chat. People who are good at communicating are\\ngenerally good at discussion.\\nIn the case of communication ability in general, you might think of someone that\\nconsiders the feeling of their conversation partner, or thinks about what is appro-\\npriate conversation for the current environment, or maybe even that they are more\\nskilled at making small talk. Although I even believe that these are valid, the most\\nessential skill to acquire is discussion ability. In addition, I would like to explain\\nabout three very important technical concepts in this book.\\nThe ﬁrst is data analytics, which is a scienti ﬁc system for gathering objective\\nfacts (data) in large quantities, analyzing data probabilistically and statistically, and\\nmaking new discoveries. The second is natural language processing, a technique for\\nanalyzing and generating human language. The third type is gami ﬁcation, which is\\na methodology that introduces game elements (such as scoring points and com-\\npetition, to gradually increase the skill level of the target by giving a sense of\\naccomplishment, etc.) for daily activities.\\nThese three concepts play an important role in ef ﬁciently improving discussion\\nability. Data analytics is used in the objective analysis of human behavior, and\\nnatural language processing is used to extract features of human behavior, espe-\\ncially to extract and utilize features contained in words. One should think about\\ntraining for discussion ability in the same way as training for improvement in\\nsports. In other words, we need self-analysis and practice to overcome weaknesses\\nand improve strengths.\\nHowever, different from sports, discussion is an intellectual activity, and those\\ndata are composed mainly of words. Although the technology concerning the\\nanalysis of words is considerably advanced, it is still very dif ﬁcult to analyze its\\nsemantic contents with high accuracy. So, I will propose a creative idea. That is to\\nattach attributes to people ’s remarks. We think about what we want to discuss next,\\nand decide if it is related to the previous speaker ’s speech or not, then we categorize\\nthe speech. Of course, if you follow conversation properly as a human, you can\\nv'),\n",
              " Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Artificial Intelligence Accelerates Human Learning_ Discussion Data Analytics ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'page': 5}, page_content='understand without the need for categorization. However, it is quite dif ﬁcult for a\\nmachine to judge the relatedness of remarks in the same manner. Interestingly, if\\nyou were to ask most people if they were aware in what way their utterances were\\nrelated to the ﬂow of the conversation, you would ﬁnd that in most cases they are\\nnot completely aware. To tell the truth, it is good for both machines and human\\nbeings to listen to other people ’s speech and think about the connections.\\nWe now think about how to apply data analytics to a discussion, where the\\nsimplest analysis is to examine the number of remarks produced by each partici-\\npant. After collecting data for around a year, one of the ﬁrst things we found was\\nthat people with a higher number of utterances were found to have a higher level of\\ncommunication ability in comparison to those who produced less utterances. Of\\ncourse, there are some people that make many utterances with little content.\\nHowever, we have established practical policies for our meeting system in our lab\\nthat encourage thoroughly listening to the speech of others before talking during\\ntheir turn and to produce utterances that are related to the previous speech or if it is\\nnot related to ask clear questions.\\nNext, we examine the relationship between a remark and the preceding utter-\\nance. This makes it easier for analysis by having metadata on speech. What I\\nlearned from the analysis is that people who are good at discussions tend to make\\nrelated remarks when someone speaks related to their remarks. In other words,\\npeople who are capable of making related statements consecutively will have high\\ncommunication skills.\\nBy using data analytics, you can explain such things with a clear basis.\\nOn the other hand, what is gami ﬁcation? Applying game-like elements to\\neveryday activities is not an entirely new concept. We all are familiar with the\\nteacher praising the ﬁrst student to get a question right in front of the class.\\nIt is an important requirement for games to reward achievement of tasks, allow\\ncompetition with multiple people, and show results in an easy-to-understand\\nmanner before the player grows bored of the game, but this also can apply to daily\\nactivities where it isn ’t rare to gauge motivation.\\nNevertheless, why try to systemize games with a name like gami ﬁcation? To that\\nend, information technology (IT) is also heavily involved. Data are important here\\nas well. In short, IT is a mechanism that processes digitized data to suit the cir-\\ncumstances of human beings, so gaming can also actively utilize the data to expand\\nits effect. For example, a small survey can now be easily ﬁlled out via smartphone\\nwith the results being quickly summarized for everyone present to view. If you\\nhappen to have past data from a similar survey, you can quickly compare it and\\ncarry out statistical processing. In this way, IT is providing humans with new\\nopportunities to think. The fact that we are able to collect and quickly process\\ninformation for human understanding will change our de ﬁnition of what is possible.\\nSo, I would like to try to make discussion a game. Some might think that there\\nalready exists debate which is like discussion made game-like. Debates have clear\\nrules and frameworks to decide the outcome. Given a problem, such as “whether the\\nJapanese constitution should be revised ”, arguing and arguing against and against,\\nwe will compete to determine which claim is more convincing. We can imagine that\\nvi Preface'),\n",

However, it is far from the commu-\\nnication which we usually do. We will express our opinion based on our thinking\\nand experience. It is constructive to train people thinking about how to express such\\nopinions effectively to the opponent. Debate is not appropriate for it.\\nThen, what should we do?\\nRules like debate are not necessary for training to improve discussion. However,\\nthere are some restrictions. In order to introduce gami ﬁcation, at least you need to\\ndo the following. First, you have the speaker record their name when they speak\\nand whether their remarks are related to previous statements. This also makes it\\neasy to use IT, so that you can enter it automatically for the former speaker. Next,\\nwhen someone ’s remarks are over, we will evaluate that statement. This evaluation\\nis a little dif ﬁcult, but here it is easy to think that it is whether you were convinced\\nby the remark or not by entering yes or no. In fact, you may have to enter somewhat\\nmore complicated things, but that is when the stage in the game has advanced.\\nThe way to train the discussion ability using IT like this is very effective. We\\nhave been doing research on this for over 10 years. This book is written to share the\\nresearch results with readers. In addition, I will explain data analytics and gami-\\nﬁcation in order to understand the research contents. Of course, I would like to\\ntouch on arti ﬁcial intelligence which is the cutting edge of IT, especially machine\\nlearning and data mining.\\nIt would be an unexpected pleasure if readers would someday become good at\\ndiscussions and communication by utilizing our research.\\nI greatly appreciate the assistance provided by people who contributed to this\\nbook.

An example of this is called e-learning or\\nintelligent tutoring systems (ITS). e-Learning is an educational system using online\\nmedia and has developed together with web technology. ITS was developed using a\\nrule-based system which is an initial result of artiﬁcial intelligence. In the process,\\nuser models for learners called learner models and educational contents have been\\nimproved. As an application of data science, technology called learning analytics\\nwas developed. This is a technique for statistically analyzing learner’s historical\\ndata obtained by e-learning, etc. and discovering the characteristics of the learner.\\nThis will contribute to personalized learning that adapts the educational system to\\nthe learner’s characteristics. Furthermore, the development of learning analytics will\\nclarify the concept of evidence-based education. As with medical care, we should\\nconstruct a feedback loop that educates in accordance with data-based analysis and\\nthe learning strategies obtained from it, and improves if there are problems. Machine\\nlearning, which is an important achievement of recent artiﬁcial intelligence, is used\\nfor data analysis at this time.

Although the answer is not ﬁxed, it has been aimed\\nat realizing intellectual support from almost two perspectives so far.\\nOne is to adaptively adapt to individual learners, that is, adaptation according to\\nthe characteristics of each learner from the viewpoint of “teaching”.\\nThe other is to provide appropriate learning environments and tools for learn-\\ners from the viewpoint of “learning”, to build a foothold for problem-solving and\\nlearning, called scaffolding.\\nIn order to realize these supports, the design and development methodologies of\\nsystems and element technologies have been explored while utilizing theories and\\nknowledge in related ﬁelds such as cognitive science and pedagogy.\\nThe origin of such inquiry dates back to the study of intelligent computer-assisted\\ninstruction from the 1970s to the 1980s.\\nFrom that time on, the composition of the system necessary for realizing intel-\\nlectual educational support with the following four factors (1) teaching knowledge\\nexpressing how to teach, (2) teaching material knowledge showing teaching knowl-\\nedge, (3) knowledge state and understanding state of the learner, and (4) the user\\ninterface to realize bidirectional dialogue (Carbonell 1970) has been taken into con-\\nsideration, and these elements have directed the research and development of edu-\\ncation and learning support technologies up to today.\\nIn particular, it has been found that it is indispensable for the advancement of\\nintellectual support by the system to represent the various knowledge necessary for\\nsupport structurally.\\nThis point is consistent with the methodology of expert system development in\\nknowledge engineering (Clancey 1987) and has had a very signiﬁcant impact on\\nsubsequent educational support system development.\\nEspecially in the educational support system research, emphasis shifted from\\neducational orientation to learning oriented since the 1990s, and the paradigm of\\nresearch has shifted to a learner-centered system (Norman 1996).\\nProgresses in information and communication technology pushed this paradigm\\nshift.'),\n",

This approach also leads to\\nencouraging learner’s introspection by scrutinizing information on the learner model,\\nand high learning effect is expected.\\nAlso, even if errors and knowledge states found from learners’ inputs are generated\\nas learner model information, learners do not necessarily recognize them.\\nFor such deviations between model expressions and learner’s recognition, meth-\\nods to promote self-recognition for errors by visualizing errors have been proposed.\\nThese can be thought of as an attempt to effectively supplement information\\nlacking as a learner model expression by interaction.\\nFurthermore, in the e-learning environment, enormous learning log data from the\\nlearner group is accumulated in learning management system (LMS) and e-portfolios,\\nand this large-scale data can be analyzed. Then, it is possible to discover learning\\nbehavior patterns and new attributes that characterize learners that were not supposed\\nbeforehand.\\nThis activity is called learning analytics and is an attempt to convert the amount\\nof data into quality data and to ﬁnd a new learner modeling technique (Ochoa et al.\\n2014).'),\n",

Supporting the smooth\\nimplementation of the curriculum is also a major embodiment of e-learning.\\nAdditionally, in thinking about things in phases for education and training in\\npractice, we need to realize that there is more to be concerned with than just students\\nusing the systems; we have a beginning planning phase where we need to think about\\nplans for what and how we will teach and a post-evaluation phase where we need to\\nevaluate our measurements concerning educational effectiveness.\\nIn this way, it is part of e-learning to manage the achievement goal of the cur-\\nriculum and the achievement progress level of individual learners and to support\\nfeedback for the implementation of the next curriculum.\\nThe main information in e-learning is related to content/learner/learning sys-\\ntem/learning history.

This aspect is similar to ﬂipped\\nlearning but still has the beneﬁts of face-to-face learning, creating a more effective\\nblended learning environment.\\nLearning Catalytics, developed by Professor Eric Mazur of Harvard University in\\n2011, applies a learning method called peer instruction in which “learners mutually\\nteach each other.” There, it provides a function to verify the effect of peer instruction\\nby analyzing the response of each student who used a clicker (personal response\\nsystem: PRS) in the classroom over time. It also has a recommendation function\\nthat presents a combination of students to further enhance the possibility of reaching\\ncorrect answers.\\nIn this way, learning analytics can be used in various teaching/learning modes\\nranging from online lecture/teaching materials, blended learning and face-to-face\\nlessons, but the scope of application is not limited to lecture/class level.\\nFor example, at a more macroscopic level, it is possible to analyze learners’\\ncharacteristics, studies, learning, performance data, etc. and use them for evaluation\\nand improvement of educational curriculums (Long and Siemens 2011).\\nIt is useful to examine what form of lesson/teaching material is more effective\\ndepending on the characteristics of the learner and to improve education from a\\nstructural and system viewpoint.\\nIt is also effective to think about what kind of order the lesson will be in chrono-\\nlogically to improve the learning effect.\\nWe ﬁrst mention “personalized learning,” considering that learning analytics has\\nbecome more and more important for education and learning in modern society.\\nAlready in various knowledge and information sectors of society, conversion from\\n“Supply Push” to “Demand Pull” has been aimed at individualization of services.\\nBased on educational big data obtained from a larger number of learners, it is desirable'),\n",

Therefore, in order to secure the knowledge, skills, and professional\\nfoundations necessary for individuals, individuals need a new educational system\\nthat allows them to continue learning as necessary for their lifetime.\\nWith the advancement of IT such as the Internet and multimedia technology,\\ndigitization of educational tools and contents is rapidly progressing.\\nOver 1000 paid online degree programs have already been created in the world,\\nand tens of thousands of online lectures/teaching materials are released free of charge.\\nOn the other hand, how to effectively utilize these educational resources and envi-\\nronments for learning throughout life will largely depend on the development and\\ndiffusion of learning analytics in the future.\\n1.5 Machine Learning Accelerates Human Learning\\nAt the forefront of learning analytics is “evidence-based education.”\\nThe essential technique for that is machine learning.\\nRecords of learners represented by e-portfolios are used for machine learning and\\ncan be used to suggest appropriate guidance.\\nThe educational data gathered by learning analytics will be used by the AI tutor\\nas data that are the basis for the learner’s proper learning.

In general, machine learning cannot explain how the prediction result was\\nderived, but research on “explainable AI” to make it possible is being performed.\\nA combination of learning analytics and explainable AI enables evidence-based\\neducation.

In this mechanism, we use a system (discussion mining sys-\\ntem) that acquires and analyzes discussion data in detail. In addition, in the manner\\nof gamiﬁcation, feedback on the progress of learning is easy to understand (gamiﬁed\\ndiscussion).\\nRegarding discussion mining, as explained in Chap. 2, it is a research method that\\nrecords, analyzes, and evaluates discussions in the university laboratory in detail.\\nBy expressing the relationship between statements by a tree structure, we structure\\nthe discussion, give attributes to individual statements, and make meaning of the\\ndiscussion data. Since discussion in the laboratory is strongly tied to student research\\ncontent, strengthening discussion skills will lead to promotion of student’s research\\nactivities.\\nRegarding the gamiﬁed discussion as explained in Chap. 4, we applied gamiﬁca-\\ntion to the discussion in which based on the rules, score participants’ actions (that\\nis, statements), and compete within the group to train discussion skills. Since the\\nresults are fed back for each action, it is easy to understand the state of the partici-\\npant himself/herself and others, and it is easy to maintain motivation to continue the\\naction. The goal can be decided for each participant, and the list of goals presented\\nas an option is associated with a system (courseware) for learning discussion skills,\\ndepending on the current situation for each participant.\\nMachine learning that predicts the future state based on detailed data also plays an\\nimportant role in human learning. For example, it is possible to predict the suitability\\nof a learner and recommend a learning course suitable for it.\\nFor that purpose, we must construct a learner model (user model). The recom-\\nmendation system method can be applied to this. A recommendation system is a\\nsystem that connects products and services with users.\\nThe user model in the recommendation system should always represent the user’s\\ninterests and purposes without excess or deﬁciency. What is necessary for this is the\\ndetailed data generation of user behavior.\\nWe collect and analyze various data in educational research activities.\\nSpeciﬁcally, it is the discussion data described in Chap. 2. This is a record of all\\nthe statements of the student in the meeting (seminar) at the university laboratory.\\nThe created dataset includes audio–visual data exceeding 50,000 times of state-\\nment data (total number of participants is over 6000) and 1500 h ( ×number of\\ncameras 3) at about 700 meetings collected from April 2006.\\nWe also collect data on students’ post-meeting research activities using the system\\ncalled Creative Activity Support System described in Chap. 3.

This research result is seen as a technological breakthrough\\ndirectly linked to current deep learning. Also, from 2012 onward research has been\\nrapidly active, it is said that a tertiary artiﬁcial intelligence boom has arrived.\\nIn deep learning, learning is performed so that the error is minimized by calcu-\\nlating the output error when inputting a large amount of training data to the multi-\\nlayered neural network by the calculation method called backpropagation. At this\\ntime, conventionally, feature amounts manually set by researchers and technicians\\nof respective data such as images and sounds are automatically extracted. For this\\nreason, it is one of the great advantages of deep learning that the feature quantity\\nextraction by hand is almost unnecessary.'),\n",

By using the GPU, it is said that price per\\nperformance and power consumption can be suppressed to 1/100th of a CPU.\\nThe most important techniques in deep learning are convolutional neural networks\\n(CNN) and recurrent neural networks (RNN).\\nConsider, for example, an all-coupled neural network in which all the nodes of\\neach layer are coupled between layers.\\nAt this time, the number of parameters becomes very large, not only the learning\\nefﬁciency is deteriorated but also excessive learning (excessive adaptation to the\\ntraining data and deterioration of accuracy in the test data) is likely to occur. Also, if\\nit is attempted to treat not only one-dimensional vectors but also three-dimensional\\nmatrices as one layer (mainly in the case of images), calculation becomes much\\nmore troublesome. Considering a ﬁlter that can be applied to a speciﬁc region of\\none layer, the value obtained through the ﬁlter is taken as the input to the next layer.\\nAccordingly, it is possible to determine the correspondence relationship between the\\nlayers only by the parameters set in the ﬁlter. This operation is called convolution.\\nThe general shape of CNN used in actual image recognition is as shown in Fig. 1.1.\\nDetailed explanation will be omitted, but when an input image is given, features of\\nthe image are extracted by the operation of convolution and pooling, the extracted\\nfeatures are input to the entire combined network, and the class of the image is\\nﬁnally estimated. Here, pooling is rough resampling of the convolution output of\\nthe previous layer (for example, taking the maximum value of the value in the n ×\\nn region of the input image, etc.). This makes it possible to absorb the difference\\nin appearance due to some deviation of the image, and it is possible to acquire the\\ninvariable feature amount with a slight shift.\\nThe connection pattern between neurons (nodes) in CNN is inspired by the visual\\ncortex of animals.

Therefore, an RNN that can handle time series information before and\\nafter was proposed. An example is shown in Fig. 1.2.\\nThe content of the hidden layer at time t becomes the input at the next time t +1 ,\\nthe hidden layer at t + 1 becomes the input at t + 2,… and so on. That is, the state of\\nthe previous hidden layer is used also for learning the next hidden layer. Since RNN\\ncan be considered to be the same as ordinary neural network when it is expanded\\nin time, backpropagation can be applied to parameter learning as with CNN and the\\nlike. The temporal expansion of RNN can be brieﬂy shown in Fig. 1.3.\\nThe error (the difference between the teacher signal and the output) propagates\\nfrom the last time T toward the ﬁrst time 0. Therefore, the error at a certain time t is the\\nsum of “difference between teacher signal and output at time t” and “error propagated\\nfrom t + 1.” The backpropagation performed in this way is called backpropagation\\nthrough time (BPTT).\\nSince BPTT cannot perform learning without data up to the last time T, that is,\\nall time series data, it is necessary to handle long time series data by cutting off the\\nlatest time section.

Since this kind of data\\nis not possible to compress in a manner, such as taking the average, it is necessary to\\nmaintain the original data as the instances of cases. Such human intellectual-activity\\ndata should be treated as big data in the near future. We have been developing a\\ndiscussion mining system that records face-to-face meetings in detail, analyzes their\\ncontent, and conducts knowledge discovery. Looking back on past discussion content\\nby browsing documents, such as minutes, is an effective means for conducting future\\nactivities. In meetings at which some research topics are regularly discussed, such as\\nseminars in laboratories, the presenters are required to discuss future issues by check-\\ning urgent matters from the discussion records. We call statements including advice\\nor requests proposed at previous meetings “task statements” and propose a method for\\nautomatically extracting them. With this method, based on certain semantic attributes\\nand linguistic characteristics of statements, a statistical machine learning model is\\ncreated using logistic regression analysis. A statement is judged whether it is a task\\nstatement according to its probability. We also developed a method that maintains\\nthe extraction accuracy by using the discussion mining system and its extension on\\nthe basis of task statement extraction over a long period. Speciﬁcally, we constructed\\nan initial discriminant model of task statements and then applied active learning to\\nnew meeting minutes to improve the extraction accuracy. Active learning also has the\\nadvantage of reducing labeling costs in supervised machine learning. We explain the\\nimprovement in extraction accuracy and reduction in labeling costs with our method\\nand conﬁrm its effectiveness through simulations we conducted.\\nKeywords Discussion mining\\n· Discussion structure · Summarization · Task\\ndiscovery · Statistical machine learning · Logistic regression analysis · Active\\nlearning\\n© Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019\\nK.

I believe this because in comparison to daily conversation, there are many\\nmore things we must think about and decide ahead of time in regards to what we\\nplan on discussing. For example, should I expand on the current topic or conclude\\nmy point and prepare to move to another topic. Therefore, we decided to divide the\\nremarks in the discussion into two types such as “start-up” and “follow-up”. Start-up\\nremarks are those that speak about new topics, and follow-up remarks are to continue\\nspeaking on the current topic. This classiﬁcation is done manually at ﬁrst, but it can\\nbe done automatically by applying a machine learning technique.\\nAs another constraint, we decided to regard the discussion as a collection of\\ntree structures. A tree structure is a data structure that hierarchically derives from a\\nsingle point called a root to multiple points (nodes). One tree structure expresses the\\nstructure of discussion on one topic. At this time, each point of the tree structure,\\nthat is, a node is a statement or a remark, and a link connecting a node and another\\nnode is a relation between statements.\\nBy using a tree structure, various calculation algorithms can be applied. For exam-\\nple, by sorting nodes based on the distance from the route or by comparing the number\\nof nodes that have the same node as a parent (sibling nodes having a direct relationship\\nto the route), it is possible to select a certain topic to investigate more deeply.\\nWe also associate multiple discussions by generating a graph structure with links\\nbetween multiple tree structures, using the materials (presentation slides like Pow-\\nerPoint) used in those discussions. The difference between the tree structure and\\nthe graph structure is that there is no route in the graph in general, and there is not\\nnecessarily a parent node for each node (to be precise, the tree structure is a graph\\nstructure with some restrictions).\\nBy structuring the discussion in this way, it can be used as the data to be subjected to\\nscientiﬁc analysis. There are various things that you miss if you catch the discussion as\\na collection of just statements. For example, what relationships exist between which\\nstatements? If a person asks a question and another person answers it, there is a clear\\nrelationship between the question and the answer. Another person sometimes gives a\\nsupplementary explanation to someone’s statement. Between these statements, there\\nis a relationship that the latter supplements the former (adds information). Structuring\\nthe discussion is to put a relationship between the statements in this way.\\nIt can be said that the basic ability of discussion and thus communication is the\\nability to have such statements related to other statements. If this ability of someone\\nis low, that person will confuse the surroundings and will lead to spend time wasting\\njust to say things that are not much related to others.\\nHowever, it is inappropriate to say only opinions to other people’s opinions, such\\nas “I think so”. Except for deciding by majority vote, it is often insufﬁcient to express\\nonly the intention to agree. Again, you should say something like adding information.\\nIn such cases where you only agree, it is better not to speak, but just to add attributes to\\nthe remarks to be agreed. The structuring of the discussion includes not only relating'),\n",

In other words,\\nwe add points (scores) to the statements of others. This is different from showing the\\nattitude of agreeing or opposing the statements, judging whether the quality of the\\nstatement is high and attaching evaluation attributes.\\nBy saying something related to a certain statement, or by listening to and evaluat-\\ning certain statements and so on, the structure of the discussion becomes articulate,\\nand the speakers’ ability of discussion will rise. Therefore, the structure of discussion\\nis effective not only for humans but also for machines, and machines will support\\nhumans. There is a technology called data analytics which is used to make machines\\nutilize structured data. It is also a technique for humans to better understand the\\ncharacteristics of these data.\\nThere is also a technology called natural language processing for analyzing human\\nlanguage. We also use natural language processing and data analytics to analyze and\\nevaluate discussions.\\nNow, let’s take a closer look at the mechanism that we invented.\\n2.2 Discussion Mining System\\nSeminar-style meetings that are regularly held at university laboratories are places\\nwhere exchanges of opinions on research content occur. Many comments on future\\nwork are included in their meeting records. However, as discussions at meetings\\nare generally not recorded in detail, it is difﬁcult to use these for discovering useful\\nknowledge. Our laboratory, on the other hand, has been developing and operating a\\nsystem that systematically records the content of face-to-face meetings with metadata\\nand achieves support, such as that from reviews of discussion content (Nagao et al.\\n2005). Although it is essential to review tasks to set new goals in research activities,\\ntheir existence may be concealed in many other statements in the minutes.\\nTherefore, we have proposed a system to support task execution in student’s\\nresearch activities by combining a mechanism called discussion mining (hereinafter\\nreferred to as DM) that realizes data mining on the contents of the discussion and a\\nmachine learning method called active learning, and we have developed a mechanism\\nto operate it for a long time.\\nIn our laboratory at Nagoya University, we have used this DM system to record\\ndetailed meetings in the laboratory for over ten years. This system enables all par-\\nticipants to cooperate to create and use structured minutes. This system is not fully\\nautomated, i.e., the secretary manually writes the contents of the speech, and each\\nspeaker tags his/her speech. Therefore, we can generate data with high accuracy.\\nAs mentioned at the beginning of this chapter, there are two kinds of tags given\\nto remarks, one tag is a newly introduced topic to introduce new topics, and the\\nother is a tag of continuous talk continuing the topic already discussed. In the case of\\ncontinuing utterances, it is necessary to clarify from which remarks they continue.'),\n",

This tree structure is\\nvisualized in real time during the meeting and it is used to overlook the discussion.\\nThe meeting style supported by the DM system is that the presenter explains a\\ntopic while displaying slides, and question-and-answer with the meeting participants\\nis either conducted during or at the end of the presentation.\\nSpeciﬁcally, using multiple cameras and microphones installed in a discussion\\nroom, as shown in Fig. 2.1, and a presenter/secretary tool we created, we record the\\ndiscussion content. In the center of the discussion room, there is also a main screen\\nthat displays the presentation materials and demonstration videos, and on both sides,\\nthere are subscreens for displaying information on and images of the participants\\nwho are currently speaking.\\nThe DM system records slide presentations and question-and-answer sessions\\nincluding participants while segmenting them in time. As a result, content (discussion\\ncontent), as shown in Fig. 2.2, is recorded and generated.\\nEvery participant inputs metadata about his/her speech using a dedicated device\\nthat is called a discussion commander, as shown in the lower right of Fig. 2.1. Partici-\\npants who speciﬁcally ask questions or make comments on new topics assign start-up\\ntags to their statements. Also, if they want to speak in more detail on topics related\\nto the immediately preceding statement, they provide a follow-up tag. Furthermore,\\nthe system records the pointer location on slides, designates the location/time for\\nthe slide and information, and has a button for agreeing or disagreeing in relation to\\nstatements made during the presentation and question-and-answer session. Marking\\ninformation on important statements is also recorded.'),\n",

Although it is possible to search for the keywords of\\nstatements, they do not contain sufﬁcient information on the content to be understood\\nwhen browsing. Therefore, we adopted a method in this research in which humans\\nand machines cooperatively input these metadata.\\nIn the DM system, the presenter uploads a presentation slide by using a special\\ntool and the system automatically transmits the slide information when the presenter\\nchanges the slide page. In addition, all the participants use the portable discussion\\ncommander. The start time for the statement and the statement type are recorded, in\\naddition to the speaker ID and the seating position of the speaker, by placing this\\ndevice on the top. The end time for the statement is input by pressing a button on the\\ndevice. The system segments video/audio information on each statement by acquiring\\nthe start/end times of the statement. In addition, it is possible for a user to express\\nan attitude (agree or disagree) with respect to the statement by pressing a button on\\nthe device or to mark a statement that has an important meaning to himself/herself.\\nThe DM system is provided with a statement reservation function as a mech-\\nanism for controlling the order of statements by participants to prevent crosstalk.\\nWhen someone signals his/her intention to speak by holding the discussion comman-\\nder above them, his/her name with the type of statement is added to the statement\\nreservation list, and his/her speaking turn automatically shifts to him/her when the\\nimmediately preceding statement ends.\\nThis statement reservation function is not only used to control the order of state-\\nments but also to create a discussion structure that reﬂects human intentions. If the\\nsystem only uses the statement type without using the statement reservation function,\\nthe discussion structure that is created will be a list structure starting from the start-\\nup statement. However, the discussion structure when multiple participants express\\nopinions from various perspectives on the content of one statement is a tree struc-\\nture rather than a list structure. Therefore, when a follow-up reservation is added\\nwhile someone is speaking, the DM system generates link information between the\\nfollow-up statement and the ongoing statement. In other words, when multiple reser-\\nvations are added during speaking, a tree structure in which a plurality of follow-up\\nstatements is repeated is automatically created for one statement.\\nThe root of the tree structure in this case is a start-up statement, where all the\\nothers are follow-up statements. If several follow-up statements are added at the\\nsame time for one statement, the branches of the tree increase. Follow-up statements\\nare attached to the preceding statement, which deepens the tree structure.\\nIn addition, the secretary records the contents of the statements using a special\\ntool. This tool is linked with the discussion commander of each speaker, and when\\nthe speaker starts speaking, the “speaker and speech type” node is automatically\\ngenerated in the secretary tool. By selecting this node, the secretary can efﬁciently\\nrecord the contents of the speech during the discussion.'),\n",

What can be considered as factors that affect the\\nimportance of statements are the number of branches of that statement (the number\\nof follow-up statements following the statement), whether it is on a longer thread, the\\nsocial position of the speaker, and the cumulative number of follow-up statements.\\nAlthough we wanted to determine what statements were important, start-up state-\\nments were not always important, and statements by speciﬁc speakers were not\\nalways consistently important.\\nTherefore, we propose an algorithm to discover important statements by spreading\\nactivation (Nagao and Hasida 1998). This is based on a network where nodes are\\nstatements and links are introduced based on the structure of the discussion segment\\n(start-up/follow-up tags) and links based on the pointer referents (links of statements\\nhaving the same referred object are linked).\\nSpreading activation is a model in which the activity value of a node diffuses to\\na neighboring node through a link in a network represented by nodes and links, as\\noutlined in Fig. 2.4. In other words, the activation values of nodes closer in distance\\nto a node with a higher activation value are also higher, and conversely, a node whose\\ndistance is farther is also lower in activation value. By applying this method, it is\\npossible to calculate the relative activation value of each node for all the nodes in the\\nnetwork.\\nSpeciﬁc methods of calculation are as follows. First, we created a matrix A that\\nrepresents the presence or absence of a link between each node by assuming that the\\nnumber of nodes existing in the network is n.\\nHere, the value of ( i,j) is one if there is a link between nodes i and j, and zero if\\nit does not exist. We now create matrix W that is related to the weight of spreading\\nactivation by using matrix A.M a t r i xW is an n × n matrix obtained by dividing the\\nvalue of each row of A by the number of nonzero elements of that row (this is done to\\nFig. 2.4 Spreading activation'),\n",

Matrix C that represents a constant activation value\\nspreading from the respective nodes to the whole network is next introduced (red\\narrow in Fig. 2.4).\\nHere, the value of ci is the external input value of the constant given to node i.\\nThen, by solving the recurrence formula, X0 /equal1CX t+1 /equal1W ·Xt +C, the activation\\nvalue in the network at the time of step t (=0, 1, 2) is obtained. Here, xt,i represents\\nthe activation value of node i at step t. Finally, the activation value of each node in the\\nnetwork is calculated as t →∞ . Also, when t →∞ , the above recurrence formula\\ncan be expressed as X /equal1W · X + C so that X /equal1(E − W )−1 ·C, where E represents\\nan identity matrix).\\nWe implemented a mechanism on the browser that selects important statements\\naccording to the purpose of browsing to efﬁciently browse the recorded discussion.\\nWe speciﬁcally constructed a network where nodes from each statement from the link\\ninformation were obtained from the discussion structure and pointing acts, calculated\\nthe activation value given to each node from the agreement/opposite button and\\nmarking, and used the spreading activation algorithm. We then ranked importance\\nranking and ﬁltered the statements.\\nFor example, if the follow-up statement of statement i is j, there is a link between\\nstatement i and statement j. By repeating this, a network of statements is formed\\nfor each discussion segment starting with the start-up statement. Further, the links\\nof all the start-up statements in each discussion segment are linked with a certain\\nvirtual node. All the discussion segments recorded from this are represented by one\\nnetwork structure. We can then execute the spreading activation algorithm on this\\nnetwork structure and ﬁnd the relative activation value for each statement. V alues that\\ntake into consideration various metadata acquired at a meeting are used as external\\ninput values to be given to each node. Speciﬁc metadata include statement types,\\nbutton information for agree/disagree, marking information, speaker names, and\\nkeywords included in the object. Since the start-up statement is a premise of follow-\\nup statements in the same discussion segment, it is set so that the activation value is\\nhigher than that of the follow-up statements.\\nThe users of the discussion browser (Fig. 2.3) use the user interface to ﬁnd how\\nmuch importance is given to each item of metadata (Fig. 2.5). They can interactively\\nuse this interface and discover a set of statements that is suitable for their own reading\\npurposes. For example, if a user increases the importance of the start-up statements,\\nhe/she can efﬁciently discover the statement set that has the same topic as the start-\\nup statements, and the statement set that gained numerous agreements when the\\nimportance of the agree button information was increased by the user.\\nBy using this system, the user can view the summary of the discussion and the\\nvideo of each statement. We believe that the discussion that we usually do is very\\nimportant, so we will try to make effective use of minor content as much as possible.\\nHowever, as content increases, it will become more difﬁcult to look at each discus-\\nsion in detail. Even though it is possible to automatically extract important parts\\nby summarization, it is still troublesome to look across multiple meeting contents.\\nTherefore, it is necessary to have a mechanism that automatically discovers useful\\ninformation from the discussion.'),\n",

For example, presenters in laboratory seminars can remember suggestions and\\nrequests about their research activities from discussion content that has been recorded\\nin detail. The meeting content contains useful information for the presenters, but it\\nis onerous to read the information. As necessary information is concealed in a large\\nquantity of statements, it is not easy to ﬁnd. This is problematic if past discussions\\nare not being reviewed, even for other speakers, and not only presenters. Therefore,\\nit is necessary to extract information that concerns unsolved issues from previous\\ndiscussions. We have called statements that include future tasks “task statements”.\\nWe developed a method of statistically determining whether statements were about\\nfuture tasks, i.e., task statements (Nagao et al. 2015). Some attributes, including\\nlinguistic characteristics, structures of discussions, and speaker information, were\\nused to create a probabilistic model.\\nA task statement can include any of three types of content:\\n1. Proposals, suggestions, or requests provided during the meeting: the presenter\\nhas determined that they should be considered.\\n2. Problems to be solved: the presenter has determined problems that should be\\nsolved.\\n3. Tasks not yet carried out before the meeting: the presenter has occasionally\\nalready noted such tasks.\\nCandidates of task statements are fragments of a discussion chunk, which was\\nexplained earlier.

A coher-\\nent piece of discussion content related to tasks consists of questions/comments and\\ntheir responses. Thus, “participants’ questions/comments + presenter’s responses”\\nare a primary candidate and a target of retrieval. “Participants’ questions/comments\\nand no response” is a secondary candidate. Figure 2.6 has an example of candidates\\nfor task statements.\\nBelow, as an example of task statements manually discovered from our discussion,\\nwe list participants’ statements and their response to them:\\n(1a) I think that there is a mechanism of dynamic prediction, such as using the\\nphrase in the PowerPoint material.\\n(1b) I really want to use the current slide.\\nThe statement 1a advises the presenter and the speaker in the statement 1b\\nexpresses his willingness to do “I really want to …”, which applies to Condi-\\ntion 1 described earlier.\\n(2a) I am glad if there is a function that can move immediately by pressing a speciﬁc\\nnumber.\\n(2b) If you enter a number as it is, it conﬂicts with other inputs and when pressed\\ntogether with Shift, etc., it seems to conﬂict with other shortcuts.\\nIn statement 2a, participants inform the presenter of the request, while in state-\\nment 2b the speaker mentioned the problem in realizing the request and it has\\nnot been decided that it should be implemented at this point. Condition 2 is\\napplicable because it includes content to consider whether to implement or\\nhow to implement it.\\n(3a) If you are targeting students of Nagao Lab, you think that you are not accus-\\ntomed to typing in predictive transformations, so make opportunities to get\\nused to that predictive transformation, and think that if you use the secretary\\ntool with familiarity it will be used so much. How about that?\\n(3b) I plan to have a chance to get used to it.\\nThe statement 3a states that the participant suggests to the presenter in remark\\n3a and the speaker in statement 3b states that the proposal is scheduled to\\nexecute, and Condition 3 can be applied to it.\\nDiscovery of task statements is the result of the so-called supervised learning\\nwhere a computer learns by giving information for discrimination (called teacher'),\n",

The percentage of task\\nstatements that were marked were 73.4%, which was higher than that of the task\\nstatements for all candidates.\\nWe found distributions for the respective characters of a presenter’s and partic-\\nipants’ statements to examine whether there were characteristic tendencies in the\\nnumber of letters (characters) in task statements. We divided the number of charac-\\nters into ﬁve groups and calculated the percentages of task statements in each group.\\nThe percentage of task statements in the participants’ statements increased when\\nthe number of characters increased. This was because the number of characters in\\ntheir statements increased when the participants were making concrete requests and\\ngiving advice. In comparison, the number of characters with higher percentages of\\ntask statements was 20 or less for the presenter’s statements. The more characters\\nthere were, the smaller the percentage of task statements. We believe that if a pre-\\nsenter accepted the requests or advice from participants who were present, his or her\\nresponses would have tended to be brief.\\nWe also investigated the types of sentences included in the task statements. The\\npercentage of task statements in the participants’ statements was higher when sen-\\ntences were in present tense and in declarative form (56.1%). This was due to the\\nfact that a large amount of advice or requests were in the pattern of “should be …”\\nor “I want to …”. The percentage of task statements for the presenter’s statements\\nin past tense and in declarative form was low (29.2%). This was because presenters\\ndid not tend to use sentences in past tense when they talked about future tasks.

And its accuracy depends on the training dataset used\\nfor learning. Of course, if there is a clear difference compared with general statements,\\nthe task statement may be able to create a discrimination rule without doing machine\\nlearning. However, if the content of the statements is diverse, it is difﬁcult to apply\\nthe statement to a speciﬁc pattern.\\nTenfold cross-validation was applied to the extraction results to test and conﬁrm\\nthe effectiveness of the proposed method. The data used for veriﬁcation included 42\\ntypes of meeting content and 1637 groups of statements (candidates). Each presenter\\ncreated correct data for task statements for each type of meeting content as well\\nas the survey data provided earlier. The data used for veriﬁcation were completely\\ndifferent from the survey data.\\nWe conﬁrmed the effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of high precision\\n(index for extraction accuracy), recall (index for extraction leakage), and the F-\\nmeasure (harmonic mean of precision and recall).\\nThe extracted results from the task statements with the proposed method were a\\nprecision of 75.8%, a recall of 64.2%, and an F-measure of 69.5%. In comparison, the\\nresults for the three alternative methods of extraction were as follows. The selection of\\nstatements that were marked by the presenter had the highest precision (68.9%), and\\nthat of the statements from teachers or statements that were marked by the presenter\\nhad the highest recall (44.1%) and F-measure (48.7%). The approach we proposed\\nobtained the highest values compared with these other extraction methods.\\nAs was previously explained, the proposed method could calculate the probabil-\\nities of candidates for a task statement by using a generated probabilistic model. A\\ncandidate whose probability value exceeded a certain threshold was extracted as a\\ntask statement. We ﬁrst set the threshold value to 0.5. It was not guaranteed that this\\nvalue would be optimal. Therefore, we reevaluated the outputs of the system by low-\\nering the threshold by 0.1 from 0.5. As we found that the F-measure at a threshold of\\n0.4 was highest (71.4%), task statements should be extracted in the future by setting\\nthe threshold to 0.4.\\nSince data analytics is aimed at deriving generality that cannot be simply found\\nfrom actually obtained data, human beings teach answers to machines on a steady\\nbasis as training data, and machines learn gradually by more accurate parameter\\nestimation. We must wait for it to become smarter.\\nTherefore, to improve discrimination accuracy, it is necessary to increase the\\namount of training data. However, it is very labor intensive to give a teacher signal to\\nall statements of the enormous discussion recorded by the discussion mining system.\\nAlso, it would be desirable for the presenters themselves to be responsible for teacher\\nsignaling tasks that should best understand the content of the discussion. In this way,\\ngiving a teacher signal is a task requiring speciﬁc human knowledge, and it takes\\ntime. I will explain how to solve this problem later.'),\n",

Therefore, it is necessary to increase the\\namount of training data to improve extraction accuracy especially when the amount\\nof usable data is relatively small, as it was in this research; however, the assignment\\nof teacher signals to the statements of all minutes recorded by DM is very costly. In\\naddition, it is preferable for the presenter who best understands the content of the\\npresentation to be in charge to minimize the number of misjudgments from teacher\\nsignals, i.e., it is also a task that requires speciﬁc human knowledge. Teacher signals\\nof task statements cannot easily be generated.\\nAnother issue in supervised learning is feature changes in objects to be extracted\\nover time. There is no problem if the characteristics of the extraction target are\\ncompletely invariant, but as new students enter the lab and progress with research\\nactivities transforms each year, the characteristics of task statements to be extracted\\nchange over time.\\nThe problem with feature changes over time has often been discussed. A spam\\nmail ﬁlter is a good example. The techniques of spam mail are becoming increasingly\\nmore sophisticated, and unless the discrimination model is updated, it cannot adapt to\\nthe characteristics of new spam mail, which decreases the accuracy of discrimination\\n(Georgala et al. 2014).\\nOne concern with text minutes in DM is that there are differences in wording\\ndue to there being different secretaries who manually input text. Since strict rules\\nare not deﬁned for secretaries, the wording depends on the discretion of each person\\nin charge, and the degree of sentence summarization also differs. Since the lan-\\nguage information included in statements mostly affects extraction accuracy in the\\ntask statement extraction model, it is necessary to focus on feature changes due to\\ndifferences in wording.\\nThe discriminant model should always be updated when the amount of data to be\\nanalyzed is increased. However, it is very difﬁcult to label all data when there is an\\nincreasing amount of data, and labeling incurs large costs. We used active learning\\n(Settles 2010, Shimodaira 2000, Sugiyama and Kawanabe 2012, Liu et al. 2015)t o\\nsolve this problem, which was used to attempt to improve extraction accuracy for\\nthe limited dataset we obtained.\\nActive learning can be implemented as an algorithm in which a sample that makes\\nthe greatest contribution to updating a discrimination model from a large number of\\nsamples without teacher signals is selected by a machine, and a teacher signal is\\ngiven to it to minimize human effort. This process efﬁciently updates models. All\\nstatements in task statement extraction in the minutes of a seminar correspond to\\nsamples without teacher signals; some groups of statements are selected using an\\nactive-learning method, and the selected statement group is assigned teacher signals\\nby students who are presenters at the corresponding seminar. The research-activity-'),\n",

The technique is also suitable for improving the accuracy\\nof task statement extraction in which the cost of teacher-signal assignment is also\\nvery high.\\nA ﬁve-step procedure is repeated to apply the active-learning technique to DM:\\n1. Create a task statement extraction model using a set of statements with teacher\\nsignals to determine whether or not it is a task statement.\\n2. After a presentation has been made at a seminar, carry out task statement extrac-\\ntion by using the recently created minutes and calculate the probability value that\\neach statement is a task statement.\\n3. Select the target set of statements to which the teacher signal is to be assigned\\nby active learning.\\n4. Display the results for the selected statement set and ask the system to provide\\nteacher-signal feedback to the user.\\n5. Add the statement set with teacher signals that have been obtained to the training\\ndata of machine learning.\\nBy updating the task statement extraction model by repeating these ﬁve proce-\\ndures, it is not only possible to improve the accuracy of extraction by increasing\\nthe amount of training data but also to constantly adapt to feature changes of task\\nstatements over time.\\nInformation density is a representative algorithm of the active-learning technique\\nthat takes into account the density of the feature space as a sampling reference (Settles\\nand Craven 2008). The strategy with this algorithm is to consider that there is a large\\namount of information with higher density data; therefore, the beneﬁts of providing\\na teacher signal are thought to be great.\\nUncertainty sampling in giving a teacher signal to the most ambiguous classiﬁca-\\ntion is also a typical method of active learning (Lewis and Gale 1994). For example,\\nconsidering the classiﬁcation problem as shown in Fig. 2.8, the data to which the\\nteacher signal should be given are different between information density and uncer-\\ntainty sampling. In other words, data close to the classiﬁcation boundary are selected\\nfor uncertainty sampling, but with information density, data in which there are many\\ndata around (data with high data density) are selected.\\nSince information on teacher signals is not used for density calculation, it is\\npossible to use a large number of samples without teacher signals for learning. As\\nthe DM project has been continuing for about 10 years, and the accumulated content\\nof discussion is huge, it is very convenient to apply this method.'),\n",

Speciﬁcally, for morpheme unigrams, the number of occurrences\\nof each of nouns, verbs, adjectives, and auxiliary verbs was calculated from past\\nminutes, and those that exceeded a certain value were taken as features. Speciﬁcally,\\nI used as features, nouns and verbs that occurred with a ratio of more than 0.5%\\nout of all nouns and verbs, and adjectives and auxiliary verbs that occurred with a\\nratio of more than 1.0% out of all adjectives and auxiliary verbs. For morphological\\nbigrams, we used morpheme pairs (two consecutive morphemes) with a percentage\\nof total morphological bigram total of 0.05% or more as features. This is an input\\nvector by using a dummy variable and setting its value to 1 when a morpheme or\\na morpheme pair as a feature exists in the statement, and setting the value to 0 if it\\ndoes not exist.\\nN gram is a co-occurrence relationship (collocation) of a language unit in which a\\ncertain language unit (character, morpheme, etc.) in the document occurs adjacent to\\neach other such as two linguistic units, three linguistic units (generally N languages\\nunit). It can be thought of as representing a kind of feature of the document. The\\nN grams of two languages and three languages are called bigrams and trigrams,\\nrespectively. Also, the histogram (frequency distribution) of a single language unit\\nis called unigram.\\nN grams when language units are morphemes are called morpheme N grams.\\nAgain, as N increases, it becomes enormous data, which makes management difﬁcult.\\nTherefore, bigrams and trigrams are mainly used.\\nWhen M is the total number of linguistic units (e.g., characters), the total number\\nof possible combinations of consecutive N units is M\\nN . In the method of preparing\\na combination table of M N , the number of occurrences (frequency) is checked from\\nthe text. In this case, the computation of N grams takes time with increasing N, and\\nas a result, the data become extremely huge. It is extremely difﬁcult to store the\\nresulting data created by this method.'),\n",

In most cases, the part of speech\\nis not enough to express the meaning of words. For example, it is understood that\\nthe verb expresses “some kind of action”, but to know the speciﬁc meaning, it is not\\nenough with the part of speech information alone.\\nThen, how about using words themselves as meaning units? A word whose mean-\\ning is like another word is called a synonym. We think that the set of synonyms\\nrepresents a certain meaning (or concept). It is unavoidable to use it as a unit for\\nexpressing the meaning of a word (or morpheme) that decomposes a word, since it\\nis only a word to tell others what he is thinking to others.\\nHowever, of course, that might be a problem. It may be more convenient for you to\\nbe able to deﬁne similarities such as similar, not similar, very similar, slightly similar,\\nand not very similar. For example, how much the meaning of “writing letters” and\\n“speaking words” is similar, which is more similar to “drinking water” “eating fruit”\\nor “reading a book”, etc.\\nIn other words, it is necessary to consider the question of whether the meaning of\\nwords whose classiﬁcation is too rough in parts of speech is not expressed as a set of\\nwords themselves, but whether it can be expressed in a manner of high abstraction\\nto the extent that similarity can be considered.\\nRecently, machine learning has proposed a way to treat words as vectors rather\\nthan letters. Context information is used to create that vector. In other words, it\\ncharacterizes the meaning of the target word by another word around the word where\\nthe word appears. Such a vector is called a distributed representation of a word. In\\nthe case of characters, I care about whether or not they match, but if you have a\\nvector, you can calculate the distance between vectors and handle it numerically as\\nsimilarity. By introducing an indicator of distance to what is difﬁcult to capture the\\nmeaning of words, it means that we can handle things more ﬂexibly. Calculation\\nincreases, but computers will get faster over time, so you will not have to worry\\nabout this indeﬁnitely.\\nLet’s adopt the machine learning method. First, let’s make a word vector so that it\\ncan be applied to the learner. There is a method called one-hot that uses a dictionary.\\nFigure 2.11 shows the mechanism.\\nAs shown in this ﬁgure, numbers are added in the order of posting of dictionaries,\\na vector matching the size of the dictionary is created, and the value of the dimension\\ncorresponding to the index of a certain word becomes 1, and everything else becomes\\n0. Now you can create a one-to-one vector for every word. It is called a one-hot vector.\\nV ectors made by one-hot are not suitable for calculating similarity because they\\ndo not use context information at all, such as co-occurrence relations. So, we devise\\nthe following ingenuity. This is a method known as word2vec, and there is not much\\ntheoretical background, but since it can be easily implemented and its effectiveness\\nis conﬁrmed to a certain extent, it is one example of vectorization.\\nWord2vec is a method of expressing all words by 200-dimensional vectors (num-\\nber of dimensions can be changed), and it is possible to add and subtract words\\nby using vector representation (Mikolov et al. 2013a, b). For example, if you enter\\n“Tokyo—Japan + France” the answer will be “Paris” and if you enter “King—Male'),\n",

This allows you to create a vector from a\\nword by entering a corpus (actual document training data) into the neural network\\ncalled skipgram shown in Fig. 2.12 and learning it.\\nA skipgram takes as input w(1),…, w(T)( w(i) is a vectorized word with one-\\nhot; T is the total number of words appearing in the document). Skipgram is the\\nneural network for predicting words appearing before and after of the input w(t)( t\\nis a position of occurrence in the document).

In addition, vw is a vector representing the word w, and it is assumed that it is\\ncalculated considering the regularity of the context in which the word appears. The\\ndimension of vw is set to about 200.\\nThe result of the experiment is that the vector vw representing each word has\\nthe following properties. The ﬁrst is that the cosine similarity (a value obtained\\nby dividing the inner product of two vectors by the product of the lengths of both\\nvectors) between vectors of words that are likely to appear in the same context, such\\nas “mathematics” and “physics”, is larger than the cosine similarity between vectors\\nof other words such as “mathematics” and “cooking”. This can be thought of as\\napproximating the semantic similarity between words as cosine similarity expresses\\nthe similarity between vectors in this case.\\nThe other is a property called linear regularity between words. For example, as\\nshown on the left side of Fig. 2.13, the cosine similarity between the difference\\nvector between a vector representing “woman” and a vector representing “male”\\nand the difference vector between the vector of “aunt” and the vector of “uncle”, or\\nthe difference vector between the vector of “queen” and the vector of “king” was\\nvery high. This predicts that the semantic commonality between these words is high.\\nAlso, the right side of Fig. 2.6 shows that the relationship between singular and plural\\nforms of words is common among words.\\nThe third property is that the vector reﬂects the “degree” of the meaning of the\\nword. For example, as shown in Fig. 2.14, taking an average vector of good and\\nbest vectors, there is better in a word with the highest cosine similarity (in other\\nwords, better is in the middle of good and best). Likewise, it turns out that unhappy\\nFig. 2.13 Linear regularity'),\n",

Even if the language\\n(such as English or Japanese) differs or the dictionary for which one-hot is calculated\\ndiffers depending on sufﬁciently large training data (collection of natural language\\ndocuments), similar regularity was obtained. This will need to be veriﬁed in various\\nlanguages (the author of the original paper conﬁrmed in English and Spanish), but it\\nwill be necessary to wait for sufﬁcient data to gather for learning.\\nIn this way, the mechanism of handling the meaning of a word on a computer is\\ngreatly developed by machine learning. From now on, more appropriate vectorization\\nmethod will be devised, I think that subtle nuances that were difﬁcult to handle with\\ntraditional systems are handled well and human intention will be recognized more\\ndeeply.\\n2.8 Natural Language Processing for Discussion Structure\\nAnalysis\\nThere is a context in the discussion as well, so if you use it well, you can handle\\nthe meaning of the statement more accurately. In other words, the statement has\\nanother statement as a trigger for that, and it is related to that statement. Regarding the\\nrelationship between the statements, as already mentioned, the discussion concerning\\na topic is a tree structure, and that node is each statement. We apply natural language\\nprocessing for this structured data of discussion.\\nAs a result, you can see, for example, the following:\\nWhether someone’s statements were appropriate in that context.\\nWhether a statement by a person still contains content to be considered.\\nWhether someone’s statements were comprehensive and were good statements.\\nBased on the data obtained by discussion mining, we have constructed a machine\\nlearning model that classiﬁes statements from the viewpoint of newly introducing'),\n",

This allows you to classify speech recognition\\nresults in real time and segment them into several topics.\\nFeatures used for machine learning model construction are as follows:\\n(1) Whether or not the displayed slide image matches between a certain statement\\nand the preceding utterance.\\n(2) Whether the two previous speeches are the same as the speaker.\\n(3) How long has passed since the last statement.\\n(4) Similarity with the preceding utterance (cosine similarity between vectors\\nwhen speaking is represented as a vector expression).\\n(5) Morpheme unigram and bigram.\\n(6) Whether the slide was changed during speaking.\\n(7) Entity Grid (described later).\\n(8) Length of sentence included in statement.\\n(9) Time elapsed when pointed in the slide with the discussion commander.\\n(10) Whether or not it coincides with the pointed object pointed to by the immedi-\\nately preceding utterance when using the pointer.\\n(11) Number of sentences included in the statement.\\n(12) Whether the reference includes a referring expression (such as a pronoun).\\nEntity Grid is a model based on the hypothesis that there is regularity in the dis-\\ntribution of appearance of the elements described in the consistent text, letting the\\nsentences in the line correspond to the elements in the sentence (Barzilay and Lapata\\n2008). It is expressed as a matrix. For each term, the elements of the sentence corre-\\nspond to what is called the syntactic role in that sentence of that sentence. Speciﬁcally,\\nthere are four types: Subject (S), Object (O), Other (X), and Not Emerging (–).\\nFor example, an Entity Grid like Fig. 2.16 is created from the four sentences\\nshown in Fig. 2.15.\\nHere, we decided to put “BELL INDUSTRIES Inc.” and “Bell” of s1 and s4,\\nrespectively, into the same column named “BELL” as we concluded that they refer\\nto the same thing through a co-reference analysis method. Both are the subject of\\nthe sentence, so the syntax role is S. Even when referring to the same target using\\npronouns or the like, make similar analyzes so that they are in the same column.\\nIn order to use this Entity Grid as a feature vector, we investigate the change of\\nsyntactic role of a noun in two consecutive sentences and calculate transition proba-\\nbility. The transition probability of a syntactic role is calculated as the probability of\\noccurrence of that transition in the entire transition. For example, in the example of\\nthe Entity Grid of the sentence of Fig. 2.15 (Fig. 2.16), since “BELL” is S in s1 and\\ndoes not appear in the next sentence s2, we consider it as –, which is a transition of\\nFig. 2.15 Example text (from Paper Barzilay and Lapata ( 2008)'),\n",

Therefore, when\\nconsidering the structure of the discussion, it would be appropriate to think separately\\ninto the structure within the statement and the structure between the statements. The\\nstructure in the statement consists of the internal structure of the sentence contained\\nin the statement and the relation between the sentences.\\nRegarding the internal structure of a sentence, there is another analysis method\\nfor the relationship between sentences. The structure that spans multiple sentences\\nis called a discourse structure, but there is no decisive way to analyze how to analyze\\nit. In one example, we use a conjunction connecting sentences as a clue. If it is\\nconnected with “and” like “it is A, and it is B”, the two sentences are in a relationship\\nof adjacency, that is, the later sentence supplements the information of the previous\\nsentence. It is content which is semantically contradictory. In addition, “it is A, but\\nit is B”, the two sentences are inverse relations; there is a semantically contradictory\\ncontent in the sentence to be expected from the previous sentence. In addition to this,\\nthere are parallel, reason, assumption, limitation, time lapse, topic expansion, and\\ntopic convergence among others in relation to such sentences.\\nIf such a conjunction is not described, it is necessary to predict the relationship\\nbetween the sentences by using the contents of the two sentences (or the sentences\\nbefore and after them). As for this also, a machine learning method can be considered.\\nHowever, in this case, unlike syntactic analysis, it depends heavily on semantic\\ncontent, so it is better to use features reﬂecting the meaning in the word context, such\\nas the vector expression by word2vec described earlier.\\nWell, next is the relation between the statements, as in the ﬁrst part of this chapter,\\nwe classify the statement with two tags “start-up” and “follow-up”, and in the case\\nof “follow-up” statement, it is structured in a way to link to the original (parent)'),\n",

We use a discussion structure tagged and linked by the speakers as a correct\\nanswer, but in the ﬁrst place, we need to verify how valid these tags and links are.\\nBy the way, in the discussion mining (DM) system we developed, we are recording\\nand analyzing all the contents of the discussion on presentations using presentation\\nslides created with Microsoft PowerPoint. During the meeting, with the presentation\\nslide displayed by the presenter, when the participant makes a start-up statement and\\nthe presenter or another participant makes a follow-up statement, a series of steps\\nuntil the next start-up statement is made. We call this structure a discussion chunk.\\nAn example is shown in Fig. 2.20. A discussion chunk is considered a discussion on\\none topic.\\nIn the DM system, there is a part depending on participant’s judgment when\\ncreating discussion content, so there is a possibility that human error such as miss-\\ning information or inputting wrong information may occur. In addition, since we\\ndeveloped a minute input tool that does not hinder discussion as much as possible,\\nthere is a possibility that the intention of the speakers may not be fully reﬂected in\\nthe acquired metadata. Among the metadata acquired by the DM system, the tree\\nstructure of the discussion chunk and the text summary of the statement are greatly\\naffected by human judgment, in particular. Whether or not the statement text cor-\\nrectly reﬂects the spoken content is thought to be able to be checked mechanically\\nby using speech recognition which is also described in the next chapter, but as for\\nthe structure, if a human does not give a correct answer, machine learning does not\\nwork well. So, its accuracy is a big issue.\\nTherefore, we conducted the following experiment to evaluate the validity of\\nthe tree structure of the discussion chunks (Nagao et al. 2005). In this experiment,\\nwe ranked the top 18 segments with many statements out of discussion chunks in\\ndiscussion content created after 2007. The total number of statements included in the\\n18 chunks was 199 (of which 181 statements were follow-up statements), the average'),\n",

In this experiment, the accuracy of data was evaluated\\nby comparing the statement type and the tree structure generated by the DM system\\nwith the correct answer data created manually regarding the following items:\\n(1) Follow-up statements presenting new topics:\\nAs an empirical problem, it often happens that the topic gradually diverges as the\\ndiscussion becomes longer. Therefore, as examining individual speech contents\\nincluded in a discussion chunk with a large number of statements, there is a\\npossibility that the contents and intent of the start-up statement as the root of\\nthat segment may include a follow-up statement that does not continue the topic.\\nTherefore, by examining the number of follow-up statements presenting new\\ntopics in the chunk, we veriﬁed the validity of follow-up statements.\\n(2) Follow-up statements with incorrect parent statements:\\nThe statement reservation function of the DM system mentioned earlier gives\\nlink information between the statements based on the input time of a reserva-\\ntion when the target statement is being made. Therefore, if the user makes a\\nreservation after the statement has ended, the correct link information may not\\nbe given. For that reason, we evaluated the validity of the statement reservation\\nfunction by the number of follow-up statements of incorrect parent statements\\n(previous statements directly linked with the follow-up statements).\\n(3) Follow-up statements with multiple links:\\nIn the current statement reservation function, the number of parent statements\\nis limited to one, but when making statements that summarize the ongoing dis-\\ncussion in the chunk, more than one statement may be referred to. Therefore,\\nin order to check whether the link information acquired by the statement reser-\\nvation function is sufﬁcient, we examined the number of follow-up statements\\nwith multiple links.\\nFigure 2.21 shows an example of a comparison between the discussion structure\\ngenerated by the system and correct answer data. In this example, the statements cor-\\nresponding to (1) above is 6, the statements corresponding to (2) are two statements\\n3 and 5, the statement corresponding to (3) is the statement 4 that has links to 1 and\\nto 3.\\nCorrect answer data were created by the following procedure. First of all, in order\\nto conﬁrm whether the contents and intention of the start-up statement serving as\\nthe root of the discussion chunk are correctly reﬂected in the subsequent follow-up\\nstatements, we asked the speaker of the start-up statement of the target chunk to\\nselect statements that deviated from the intention of the start-up statement. Next, we\\nasked several university students that participated in the target discussion to make\\nthe correct answer for the above items (1), (2), and (3) while viewing the contents\\nwith the discussion browser mentioned earlier. Finally, we reviewed the students’\\nanswers and decided the ﬁnal correct answer data.\\nFigure 2.22 shows the results of comparing the structure of the discussion gener-\\nated by the DM system with the correct answer data.'),\n",

              " Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Artificial Intelligence Accelerates Human Learning_ Discussion Data Analytics ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'page': 58}, page_content='50 2 Discussion Data Analytics\\nThe consideration obtained by this experiment is as follows:\\n(1) Tendency of follow-up statements presenting new topics:\\nFrom Fig. 2.16, there were some follow-up statements presenting new topics in\\nalmost all discussion chunks. In other words, we can see that there are multiple\\ntopics in one chunk. The most frequent follow-up statement presenting a new\\ntopic was a statement that presents a topic that was inspired from the discussion\\nup to the present. For example, until the point just before, the participant was\\ndiscussing “can you split semantic units?”, the statement that cuts out a topic\\nfrom another viewpoint “can you unite semantic units in reverse?” was made.\\nWith the current statement types, we cannot divide the discussion in this ﬂexible\\nway. The longer the length of one segment is, the longer the time required for\\nbrowsing becomes. Therefore, in order to realize efﬁcient content browsing,\\nﬁner segment information is acquired by combining a technique different from\\nthe statement types.\\nIf the speaker of the start-up statement can judge whether a follow-up statement\\nis not related to the content or intention of his/her statement, it is thought that\\nﬁner segment information can be acquired.\\n(2) Tendency of follow-up statements with incorrect parent statements:\\nFour follow-up statements with incorrect parent statements were conﬁrmed. It\\nwas conﬁrmed that it is equivalent to 2.2% in all follow-up statement (181 state-\\nments). From this, it can be thought that the link information of the statement\\nacquired by the statement reservation function is valid. Also, when examin-\\ning the corresponding statements in detail, it turned out that it was caused by\\ndelayed timing of speaking. The reservation function gives link information to\\nthe statement that was being done at the input time of a reservation, but when\\nthe statement is not made at the time of reservation, the reservation function\\nis designed to give link information to the last one (of course, this rule is not\\napplied to the start-up statements). Therefore, the system cannot attach link\\ninformation to the statements made before the last statement. As a solution to\\nthis problem, there is a method of specifying the statements to be targeted when\\nthe speaker speaks. For that reason, we added a function to change the linked\\nstatement (parent statement) to the discussion commander that is a device held\\nby each participant.\\n(3) Tendency of follow-up statements with multiple links:\\nAs you can see from Fig. 2.22, many follow-up statements with multiple links\\nexisted. As checking the individual statements, there are a lot of statements\\nto express opinions and summaries based on statements and discussions until\\nthen, such as “to arrange because discussions are complicated” or “even though\\nyou were saying …”. In addition, many chunks that do not have follow-up\\nstatements with multiple links repeatedly asked questions and requested. From\\nthis, it can be said that “the statements with more links are more important\\nin the discussion,” “the discussion is more active as the number of follow-up\\nstatements with multiple links increases,” the link information can be thought\\nof as an index for the importance and activity level of discussion.'),\n",
              " Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Artificial Intelligence Accelerates Human Learning_ Discussion Data Analytics ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'page': 59}, page_content='2.9 Correctness of Discussion Structure 51\\nIt is impossible to acquire multiple link information only with the current state-\\nment types and the statement reservation function, but it can be dealt with by\\nusing the discussion commander to add the statement to be referred to as well\\nas the correction of the parent statement. In addition to the method of inputting\\nin real time, it is possible to consider how to input it after the meeting. For\\nexample, by realizing a mechanism for describing ideas by quoting multiple\\nstatements that are considered important, the system can give link information\\nthat shows relevance between quoted statements at the same time.\\n2.10 Structuring Discussion with Pointing Information\\nAs described in the previous section, the structuring of discussion chunks in our\\ndiscussion mining system is problematic. For example, more than one topic may\\nbe included in a discussion chunk. Experiments showed that the speakers who con-\\ntributed to a discussion chunk were not always talking about the same topic. As the\\ndiscussion continued, several opinions from various viewpoints tended to be given.\\nWe attribute this to two main reasons. The ﬁrst is that a new topic was introduced to\\nenrich the ongoing discussion. It would be unusual for all the remarks made during a\\ndiscussion to be about a single topic; it is more common for supplemental topics to be\\nintroduced during a discussion. The other reason is that the statement types (start-up\\nand follow-up) used were not sufﬁcient to classify all the statements in the discus-\\nsions. When a different topic was introduced in a single statement of a discussion\\nchunk, the system could not create a sufﬁciently detailed semantic structure.\\nWhen a user reviews the discussions of previous meetings by using the discussion\\nbrowser, the statements made during the meetings are numerous, and even if metadata\\nis available to help in the search effort, it may take a long time for him or her to\\nselect and read statements of interest. Therefore, further structuring focusing on\\ntopic segmentation as well as structuring on the basis of “start-up” and “follow-up”\\nis required.\\nIn our research, we focus on pointing and “referring to” behaviors during meetings.\\nSpeakers usually refer to something when making a statement, e.g., “this opinion is\\nbased on the previous comment” or “this is about this part of the slide (while pointing\\nto an image or text in the slide).” We assume that a statement with a reference to\\nan object in a slide is strongly related to the topic corresponding to the object. We\\nalso assume that two statements during which the speakers point to the same object\\nare about the same topic. Therefore, we concluded that acquiring and recording\\ninformation about pointing to objects in a slide would facilitate topic segmentation\\nand lead to more precise semantic structuring of discussions. We call a pointed object\\nin a presentation material a visual referent.\\nWe thus developed a system for pointing to and selecting objects in slides that uses\\nthe discussion commander mentioned earlier and created a mechanism for acquiring\\nand recording pointing information related to participants’ statements.'),\n",
              " Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Artificial Intelligence Accelerates Human Learning_ Discussion Data Analytics ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'page': 60}, page_content='52 2 Discussion Data Analytics\\nThis system can also extract any part of the ﬁgure in a slide and refer to it. In\\naddition, selected or extracted image objects can be moved and magniﬁed by using\\nthe discussion commander.\\nThe system also gathers various types of metadata about pointing such as identi-\\nﬁers of objects and slides, starting and ending times of pointing, IDs of participants\\nwho are pointing at objects, and IDs of statements during which objects are referred\\nto. The signiﬁcant features of our pointing system are data correctness and clear\\nvisualization of “pointed to” objects. In a previous study (Nakano et al. 2006), the\\npointing target was estimated automatically by using a conventional laser pointer\\nand visual processing. However, it was difﬁcult to accurately acquire the pointing\\ntarget. In this study, the pointing target is deﬁned using information on objects in\\nslides generated by Microsoft PowerPoint. This enables the attainment of references\\nthat correctly reﬂect the speaker’s aim.\\nIn our system, discussions are structured on the basis of metadata acquired by\\nusing our pointing system. We hypothesize that statements with the same pointing\\ntarget are on the same topic with a high probability. Similarly, it is highly probable that\\nthe topic changes when the pointing target changes. Therefore, when a statement in a\\ndiscussion chunk has the same pointing target as the previous statement, the system\\nprovides new link information between the two statements. This enables tightly\\nconnected statements to be distinguished from normally connected statements in a\\ndiscussion chunk. This reference-sharing link information, which adds new meaning\\nto the discussion structure, contributes to structuring discussions in more detail. Of\\ncourse, there are still statements on the same topic without any visual referents. Since\\nthe reference is not visualized, it is difﬁcult to deﬁne a target topic. Therefore, this\\ntype of topic sharing is removed from the scope of this research.\\nWe evaluated our improved structuring method by using data from actual meet-\\nings. First, we veriﬁed our hypothesis that a statement with the same pointing target\\nas the previous statement is, with a high probability, continuing the discussion of the\\ncurrent topic. Then we estimated the validity of structuring using pointing informa-\\ntion by evaluating the validity of this hypothesis.\\nThe discussion commander enables a user to point at and select objects shown on\\nthe screen. The user interface for selecting screen objects supports two methods as\\nshown in Fig. 2.23.\\n1. Sectional detail drawing (left of Fig. 2.18): a rectangular area on the screen\\nand chosen objects in the slide touched its rectangular range by using drag-type\\noperations of a pointer cursor on the screen.\\n2. Underline drawing (right of Fig. 2.18): text in a slide is pointed at and selected\\nby underlining it.\\nThe references to various targets such as image objects and text portions in the\\nslide are made possible by using the method appropriate for the target. These methods\\ncan also be used to acquire rich metadata about pointing.\\nSeveral types of objects are selectable: itemized text, grouped diagrams, images\\nformatted in JPEG, BMP , AutoShapes (illustrations such as polygons and ovals that\\ncan be used by Microsoft Ofﬁce applications), and tables and graphs.'),\n",

Temporary selection: a reference to an object is temporarily reserved.\\n2. Persistent visualization: the currently selected object and by whom are visualized.\\n3. Independentization: the function by which it is cut down as a target of pointing\\nwhich doesn’t depend on slide layout for enabling its movement and zooming.\\n4. Extraction: any subarea in the slide can be made independent.\\nThe pointing information is used to structure discussions, i.e., to provide new link\\ndata between those statements referring to the same object, as shown in Fig. 2.24.\\nStatements 3–6 in the ﬁgure are assumed to refer to the same object. Therefore,\\nlinks are added to the discussion tree so as to make a complete graph consisting\\nof statements 3–6. Statements referring to the same object (i.e., statements about\\nthe same topic) are connected by such links. By using these links, the system can\\ndistinguish a set of statements that are strongly connected with each other from a\\ndiscussion chunk.\\nThe speakers of statements 3–6 should be able to see that pointing to the same\\nobject created these links. However, they may ﬁnd it difﬁcult to ascertain whether\\ntheir current statements are related to the “pointed at” object during the meeting. This\\nis because they are concentrating on speaking when they are making statements even\\nif the pointing target is visualized and can easily be conﬁrmed. Of course, a speaker\\nmay point to an object and make a question consciously about it. As the discussion\\ncontinues, the speaker may tend to forget to decide whether his or her statements are\\nrelated to the “pointed at” object at that time.\\nWe thus included in our system a conﬁrmation dialogue: “is the present pointing\\ntarget related to your statement?”, and the next speaker should answer “Yes” or\\n“No”. A speaker operates his or her discussion commander and decides whether the\\n“pointed at” object is related to his or her statement content. He or she selects “Yes”'),\n",

This function can\\nprompt the speaker to consider whether his or her statements should continue to refer\\nto the object pointed at by the previous speaker when beginning a statement.\\nIt is possible to add links that reﬂect the speaker’s aim more accurately by using\\nthis function. The system can thus structure discussion chunks so that the speaker’s\\naim is reﬂected correctly and thereby support browsing of the discussion contents\\nmore efﬁciently.\\nAs described above, our proposed method for identifying statements in a dis-\\ncussion chunk with strong connections is based on the assumption that statements\\nreferring to the same pointing target are very likely about the same topic. However,\\nthis assumption was unveriﬁed. We thus conducted an experiment to conﬁrm whether\\nthe assumed correlation exists and whether the derived links are correct. Speciﬁcally,\\nwe veriﬁed the hypothesis that “a follow-up statement that refers to the same pointing\\ntarget as its parent statement is about the same topic, and it is rare that a new topic\\nis introduced in such a statement.”\\nWe used two types of data in our experiment to verify this hypothesis: (1) pointing\\ndata captured by our discussion mining system, and (2) questionnaire data about the\\nrelationships between follow-up statements and topics acquired using the discussion\\nbrowser. We collected the ﬁrst type of data by using the discussion commanders of\\nthe participants in three laboratory seminars. The participants in each seminar were\\nthe professor and three or four students (ten students in total). Each student made a\\npresentation with slides.\\nThe participants were asked to make statements and to use their discussion com-\\nmanders to point to objects on the slides during their statements. To point to paragraph\\ntext or the entire slide, they used the sectional detail drawing function. To point to\\na part of the text, they used the underline drawing function. To point to a particular\\nregion in the image, they used the independentization function. We removed the data\\ncorresponding to when they pointed to unintended objects by mistake.'),\n",

However, we ﬁrst had the participant who inputted the meeting\\ncontents by hand check to see if there was anything missing in the minute text\\nsince the minute text was an important source for the participants to complete the\\nquestionnaire.\\nThe questionnaire consisted of three types of questions: (1) ones asking about the\\nrelationship between the statement of interest and the preceding start-up statement\\n(the ﬁrst statement of the discussion chunk in which the statement of interest was\\nincluded); (2) ones asking about the relationship between the statement of interest\\nand its parent statement; and (3) ones asking about the number of topics included in\\nthe statement of interest.\\nOur analysis of the questionnaire data revealed that, when a participant was refer-\\nring to the same pointing target as the previous speaker, there was a high probability\\nthat he or she was speaking about the same topic. Our ﬁnding that there were few\\ncases in which more than one topic was introduced in a statement validates our\\nhypothesis that “speakers who make statements while referring to the same pointing\\ntarget are very likely to be speaking about the same topic in contrast to statements\\nwithout a shared reference, and it is rare that a new topic is introduced in such a\\nstatement”.\\nOur experiment revealed that some follow-up statements were about a topic dif-\\nfering from that of the start-up statement. The discussion may thus become unsettled\\nand then be abandoned because the participants do not know whether the discus-\\nsion about the previous topic reached a conclusion. We may be able to develop a\\nmechanism that can automatically identify such unsolved topics and suggest to the\\nparticipants that they discuss them again.\\nWe aim to achieve more semantic structuring of discussions by creating connec-\\ntions between statements including linguistic co-references and anaphora.\\nReferences\\nR.

This research\\nis a scientiﬁc analysis of human social interactions. We are researching a mecha-\\nnism to promote innovation by supporting discussions based on the premise that\\ninnovations result from discussions. Ideas are created and developed during conver-\\nsations in creative meetings like those in brainstorming. Ideas are also reﬁned in the\\nprocess of repeated discussions. In our previous research of discussion mining, we\\nspeciﬁcally collected various data on meetings (statements and their relationships,\\npresentation materials such as slides, audio, and video, and participants’ evalua-\\ntions of statements). We developed a method to automatically extract important\\nstatements to be considered after the meetings by using the collected data. Actions\\nsuch as investigations and implementations are performed in relation to these state-\\nments. Here, we present an idea that automatically extracted statements leading to\\ninnovations facilitate creative activities after meetings. Our research was aimed at\\ndeeply analyzing face-to-face meetings and supporting human creative activities by\\nappropriately feeding back knowledge discovered in the meetings. We particularly\\nanalyzed the features of statements made during discussions. We developed a sys-\\ntem called a “meeting recorder” for that purpose. The meeting recorder consists of a\\n360° panoramic video camera that records meetings in audio–visual scenes, a tablet\\napplication that allows users to browse meeting materials and add various notes to\\nthem with a stylus, speech recognition that identiﬁes speakers and transcribes speech\\ncontents of all meeting participants, and a minute server that integrates all meeting-\\nrelated information and creates the meeting minutes. We also developed a system\\nthat supports the activities after meetings called the “creative activity support sys-\\ntem.” This system supports users in quoting statements extracted from the minutes,\\nin writing notes and reports, in creating activity plans, in managing schedules to\\naccomplish tasks, and in evaluating other members’ results within the group.\\nKeywords Meeting analytics\\n· Meeting recorder · Creative activity support ·\\nPDCA cycle · Evaluation of creativity\\n© Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019\\nK.

Of course, that did not solve all the prob-\\nlems of intelligence, but at least from several years ago, the work we can automate\\nhas increased considerably. Recent artiﬁcial intelligence introduces machine learn-\\ning technology (or improves machine learning mechanism previously introduced)\\nto various human-supported information systems which have been researched and\\ndeveloped for quite some time. The systems with recent artiﬁcial intelligence tech-\\nnology are a system that can become smarter by collecting data.\\nThere is also a place where artiﬁcial intelligence can be active even in the area\\nof meeting support. It is not a story of automating the meeting itself to make human\\nbeings unnecessary but to try to make artiﬁcial intelligence take over work of the\\nsurroundings so that human beings can fully demonstrate creativity and improve\\nproductivity. Even at the meeting, various data can be gathered by incorporating\\nvarious ideas into the system, which can be used for machine learning. However,\\nas explained in Chap. 2, in the case of supervised learning, a teacher signal (correct\\nanswer data) is necessary. Also, by using the active-learning method also described\\nin Chap. 2, human beings can update their learning models by making appropriate\\nfeedback with little effort. The learning model here is a predictive probabilistic\\nmodel that is useful for appropriately advancing the meeting, efﬁciently reviewing\\nthe contents of the discussion, and appropriately reﬂecting it in subsequent activities.\\nSpeciﬁcally, this model contributes to improving the accuracy of recognition and\\nsummarization and ﬁnding important issues more accurately.\\nThe mechanism to promote the improvement of discussion ability will be\\ndescribed in the next chapter of this book, but here I will explain another meeting\\nsupport system and its functions we developed.\\nFor creative meeting support, we applied machine learning techniques for discus-\\nsion activity data obtained using a discussion mining system described in Chap. 2\\nthat structures the meaning of a meeting’s content and records it. We call this dis-\\ncipline of analyzing meetings and automatically mining valuable information from\\nthem “meeting analytics.”\\nAs an important tool for meeting analytics, we developed a system called the\\nmeeting recorder that records and analyzes small-scale and face-to-face meetings in\\ndetail. It consisted of an Internet of Things device with a 360° all-around panoramic\\ncamera, tablets for all participants, and a server computer. This was aimed at achiev-\\ning a simpliﬁed portable version of the discourse mining system and it was also\\naimed at fully automating the creation of the minutes.\\nThe system records meeting scenarios with a panoramic camera and tracks par-\\nticipants’ faces by assuming that there are people walking around in meetings. The\\nsystem also simultaneously collects all the participants’ voices with small wear-\\nable microphones.

These are simultaneously transcribed using\\nspeech recognition on the cloud and displayed on the tablets of all participants.

As a result, meetings could only be\\nheld in certain rooms. In order to take a lot of data, it is necessary for everyone to be\\nable to use it easily, so it was necessary to redesign to make installation easier.\\nThe meeting recorder includes a panoramic camera that records meeting land-\\nscapes, a tablet application that allows users to browse slide materials and freely add\\nthem with a pen, a speech recognition system that identiﬁes speakers and transcribes\\nthe contents of utterances. The tablet and the panoramic camera are connected to the\\nminutes server by wireless network. In other words, if you install a server in the same\\nfacility, you can carry out a meeting using the system by carrying only the tablet and\\nthe camera. In addition, all the participants are wearing a small wearable (wearable)\\nmicrophone on one ear. This is so that participants can record and recognize that\\nperson’s voice without fail even if they walk around. This microphone is connected\\nwirelessly to the tablet, voice is transmitted to the speech recognition cloud (e.g.,\\nGoogle or Amazon) in real time via the tablet, and the recognition result is collected\\nin the minutes server.\\nOn the minutes server, machine learning is used to estimate statements that change\\nthe topic in discussion. By doing so, the system can divide the minutes by topic, and\\nconsider the number of statements and the number of speakers in that topic, then the\\nsystem can decide the importance of each topic.\\nIf the discussion can be further structured, more sophisticated processing can be\\nrealized. In order to structure it, it is necessary to gather a lot of data. This system\\ncollects and analyzes various data including audio and video about meetings in the\\nsimplest possible way.\\nFor example, as described in Chap. 2, we construct a tree structure using the\\nrelationship between statements and between statements and slide materials, and\\nthen perform spreading activation on it. Spreading activation is a mechanism that\\ngives a high activation value to a node with a high degree of reference on the graph,\\nand by using this activation value, it is possible to calculate the importance of the\\nstatements.\\nThe system can select topics with high priority and statements with high impor-\\ntance and present them as a summary of the meeting minutes. Also, the system will be\\nable to remind the participants to discover statements that describe important issues\\nto be solved in the near future, such as the task statements mentioned in Chap. 2.\\n360° spherical panoramic cameras (or simply panoramic cameras) are now being\\nsold for the general public. This is a camera that can shoot pictures and images of 360°\\naround the camera. Because it is a mechanism with two ﬁsheye lenses overlapped,\\na distorted image as shown in Fig. 3.2 is taken, so use PC to convert it to an image\\nlike a normal camera shot and display it.

By analyzing the position of the partici-\\npant’s face in the panoramic image, it is possible to ﬁnd the image of the speaker at\\nthat time in the panorama from the speaker ID and the speaking start time.\\nAlso, as mentioned above, participants all wearing a small microphone in their ears\\nand participate in the conference, and the voice of all the participants is recorded\\nseparately. Then, as shown in Fig. 3.3, the speech recognition result and meeting\\nmaterials such as presentation slides are displayed synchronously on the tablet of each\\nparticipant. On the right side of the screen shown in Fig. 3.3, the speech recognition\\nresults are displayed in a chat log format. The user’s own utterance is displayed\\nright aligned, the other utterances are displayed left aligned, and color coded for\\neach person. This color also matches the pen stroke color of the corresponding\\nuser. Meeting materials are displayed on the left side of the screen, so that writing\\ncan be done with a pen. The user can also use it like a whiteboard by making the\\nbackground white, without displaying the document. At the top of the screen, a part\\nof the utterance content that represents the topic at that time is displayed.\\nThe minutes created by the meeting recorder include images, sounds, images,\\ntexts, and can be searched and viewed using a Web browser.

That is because the meeting recorder is not designed to manu-\\nally tag the statement types and to specify the parent statement in the case of follow-up\\nstatements in order to reduce the burden on participants. Therefore, we need to struc-\\nture the discussion recorded by the meeting recorder based on the training data of\\nthe discussion content created and accumulated in the discussion mining system.\\nThis makes it possible to use various functions used in discussion mining. The func-\\ntions include summarization of discussion content and discovery of task statements\\ndescribed in Chap. 2.\\nRegarding how to construct a tree structure, we begin by classifying the set of\\nstatements by topic. However, to understand what topics are, we need a fairly sophisti-\\ncated semantic processing, so we modeled the tags (“start-up” and “follow-up”) given\\nby discussion mining and employed a machine learning technique as described in\\nChap. 2. If a statement that is supposed to be start-up type appears, the system consid-\\ners that the topic has changed. In this way, since tagged statement data of discussion\\ncontents accumulated in the DM system can be used as it is as training data. Of course,\\nusing the data of the meeting recorder, if we perform active learning as mentioned\\nin Chap. 2, we will be able to improve classiﬁcation accuracy with minimal effort.\\nAssuming that tags of “start-up” and “follow-up” could be estimated for the state-\\nments, the next thing to do is to investigate which statement before a follow-up\\nstatement is related to the follow-up statement. In order to solve this problem, we\\napply a technique called conditional random ﬁeld (CRF) (Qu and Liu 2012). This\\nmethod gives attributes in a probabilistic way to each data included in the sequence\\ndata (the data arranged in order). As in speech recognition, the one-dimensional\\nconditional random ﬁeld is suitable for problems such as allocating phonemes to\\nmorphemes and assigning phonemes to divided waveforms. In addition, the two-\\ndimensional conditional random ﬁeld is suitable for the problem of estimating the\\ndependency between data in series data. Therefore, in order to estimate the depen-\\ndency between the statements and construct the tree structure of the discussion, we\\nwill use the two-dimensional CRF (2D CRF).\\nThe 2D CRF has the structure as shown in Fig. 3.5. In this ﬁgure, the dependent\\nelement (i.e., follow-up statement) is called the source, and the depended element\\n(i.e., parent statement) is called the target. The CRF is one of stochastic graphical\\nmodels (graphical representations in which nodes are random variables) represented\\nby undirected graphs (graphs in which nodes are connected by undirected links), and\\nthe link represents the dependency between random variables.\\nIn Fig. 3.5, the case where the same statement has different parent statements is\\nrepresented by nodes in the vertical direction, and the case where several follow-\\nup statements depend on the same parent statement are represented by nodes in the\\nhorizontal direction. Like other machine learning methods, we estimate the parameter\\nθ that maximizes the conditional probability of using the stochastic gradient descent'),\n",

X is called the observation value (objective variable) and Y is called the latent\\nvariable (explanatory variable). Although details are omitted here, this mechanism\\nmakes it possible to structure the discussion recorded by the meeting recorder as a\\ntree structure similar to the DM system.\\nIn the case of content recorded with the meeting recorder, we regard the region\\nmarked with a pen stroke within the presentation material instead of a pointer as\\na visual referent (it is not necessarily a slide if it is a meeting material). Since the\\nmarking is shared by all the tablets, the user can select other people’s marking area\\nand make a statement about it, and the system can check the match of the visual\\nreferent between the statements.\\nThis makes it possible to apply the model learned with discussion mining data to\\nthe data of the meeting recorder. Of course, depending on the content of the meeting,\\nthe prediction accuracy by the machine learning model may not be sufﬁcient, so\\nwe need to update the machine learning model using the active-learning method\\ndescribed in Chap. 2. In order to do that, after the meeting, the system needs to get\\nthe user feedback which is the information equivalent to the teacher signal.\\nI will next explain how the system that supports the users’ actions after the meeting\\nand acquires data to improve the machine learning model at the same time.\\n3.3 Post-meeting Assistance to Support Creative Activities\\nWe developed another system to extract important statements and task statements\\nand to reﬂect them in subsequent activities to make effective use of the meeting\\nresults. This system consists of a function that involved writing notes and reports\\nby quoting statements, a function that involves managing schedules concerning the\\nexecution of tasks, a function that involves disclosing and sharing notes and reports\\nin a group, and a function that involves group members mutually evaluating reports.\\nWe call the system a “creative activity support system.”\\nThe creative activity support system is a system that guides subsequent activities\\nfrom immediately after a meeting has been held based on the results obtained from\\ndiscussions. As there is a possibility of forgetting content for a while after meetings,'),\n",

We implemented\\nfunctions that users could easily remember to quote task statements, formulate action\\nplans, reﬂect on schedules, and be appropriately reminded of the task execution plan\\nfor that reason.\\nIt is not easy to steadily complete various tasks that arise in work and research.\\nIndeed, there have been many arguments on how to manage tasks to achieve success,\\nand many scheduling support systems, such as Google Calendar, have been developed\\nto support this need.\\nMost conventional scheduling support systems have only been focused on man-\\naging the schedule of plans, and not on understanding how an established schedule\\nis processed and what state it is in before proceeding to the next task. There is no\\nsupport in implementing tasks that have causal relationships over the long term, such\\nas setting guidelines. One major issue related to graduation and completion studies\\nis addressed by carrying out individualized tasks that have been segmentalized in a\\nlong-term time series, so the plan–do–check–act (PDCA) cycle in business execution\\nis recommended for education as well (Osone and Uota 2015). It is necessary to have\\na mechanism to support the smooth execution of a series of performance cycles of\\nplanning, executing, and evaluating tasks.\\nBy using the creative activity support system, the users quote the statements\\nextracted from the minutes, write notes and reports, form action plans and sched-\\nules them. The reports on achieved tasks are published to view and evaluate in the\\ngroup. Furthermore, in the future, we will be able to model the process of devel-\\nopment of ideas by machine learning. To that end, what kind of evaluation was\\nused/reconsidered by the idea presented at the meeting, what kind of opinion came\\nout when presented at the meeting again, what kind of evaluation was given when\\nthe task derived from the idea was achieved. Based on the results of this analysis, we\\nwill construct a machine learning model to estimate the creativity of ideas.\\nBy applying this model to the initial idea, you can predict the future development\\nof the idea. Evaluation of idea creativity can be used to set priorities for multiple\\nideas for similar problems. I believe that people can accelerate innovation by working\\naccording to this priority. I will talk more about this in Chap. 6 of this book.\\nAs we will return to in Chap. 6, our purpose is not just to develop the system to\\nsupport humans by recording meetings and discovering knowledge. Another goal is\\nto support the general creative activities of humans and to create an environment that\\nenables humans to perform more creative work more efﬁciently. At the same time,\\nwe are thinking about a mechanism that humans can extend their potential and that\\nthe system can improve its accuracy simultaneously. Then, the expansion of human\\ncapability will be a positive cycle.\\nIn other words, post-meeting assistance contains two main items. One is to make\\nthe participants utilize the knowledge gained at the meeting for the subsequent activ-\\nities, and the other is to evaluate and cultivate discussion ability of the participants\\nthrough meetings.'),\n",

This is a system to select and review the task state-\\nments estimated by the machine learning model trained by the contents structured\\nby the meeting recorder and the DM system, to conﬁrm the tasks, and to create, edit\\nand organize the activity notes. The user can also classify past meetings by topic and\\nselect and review some important statements.\\nActivity notes can include quotation of related task statements and organize items\\nto achieve tasks found during and after the meeting. The task statement is associated\\nwith the discussion content, so the user can also view the surrounding statements.\\nThe task statements quoted by this tool are registered as correct answer data and\\nare used for relearning. Active learning as described in Chap. 2 allows the user to\\nselect a statement to which a teacher signal should be given. By emphasizing the\\ncandidates of task statements on the tool, it can prompt the user to browse and quote\\nthem. Teacher signals for incorrect answers will be given to statements that were not\\nquoted even after some time.'),\n",

In many cases,\\nresearch will ﬁrst decide the theme, think about the next goal in that theme and the\\nissues related to that subject. The important thing in solving the problem is that it\\nachieves some goal. In other words, it is necessary to take into consideration which\\ngoal is set in detail in advance, which element of that goal is tied to the tasks to be\\ncarried out and achieved by that solution.\\nThe state of awareness of students with little experience in research activities who\\nonly use the number of tasks is disadvantageous because of the uncertainty regarding\\nexecution. Therefore, after the existence of tasks is identiﬁed, each task should be\\nwell organized and scheduled to use time efﬁciently. The task scheduler works well\\nfor scheduling the duration of task executions.\\nThere is a graph at the top of the screen of the task scheduler that can roughly\\norganize the proportion of information by type (e.g., surveillance, development, and\\nexperiment) of tasks and their situation with achievement. The user can arrange and\\nupdate the time intervals of tasks scheduled to be executed on the timetable at the\\nbottom of the screen.\\nAlso, if multiple activities are to be performed in parallel, it would be better if\\nthe planning is done after checking whether there are dependencies on tasks to be\\nperformed and considering priorities. For example, if it is assumed that implemen-\\ntation of program X is necessary to carry out task A, and that program X can be\\nimplemented by modifying program Y , which is a result of another task B, then task\\nA has a dependency to task B. In that case, it is more efﬁcient to achieve task B earlier\\nthan task A. In order to discover such dependency between tasks, we analyze the\\nactivity notes and the quoted task statements and the discussion contents, because\\nthey are good resources to ﬁnd clues about task dependency.\\nAs a way to gain insight into dependency, we analyze the similarity of topics,\\nthe commonality of speciﬁcations or functions of anticipated results, relationships\\nbetween the original idea and derived discussions, and so on. Anyway, if we continue\\ndiscussion at meetings, the discussion content should deﬁnitely include data that can\\nbe used for reasoning of task dependency.\\nThe most important thing in executing a task is that it achieves some goal. In other\\nwords, it is necessary to ﬁrst consider what target is set, which part of the goal is\\nassociated with the task to be carried out, and what will be achieved by the solution.\\nThe creative activity support system has a map that roughly describes the entire\\nactivity in tree structure form [called mind map (Buzan 1990, Beel and Langer 2011)]\\nand can search which part of the target is related to the problem to be solved from\\nthe map as shown in Figs. 3.9 and 3.10 (Fig. 3.10 is an enlarged center of Fig. 3.9).\\nThen, the user can search on the map which part of the goal is the issue to be\\nsolved. By doing so, the users can continue their activities while conﬁrming that\\nthey are heading toward the goal by doing so, and not just executing the task in front\\nof them.\\nWe must begin by being aware of the problems that confront us at the moment to\\nfacilitate creative activities.

In other words, the extent to which ideas were reﬁned\\nand materialized after discussion was used as an indicator of creativity.\\nThe ideas should appear in the statements in the discussions and be extracted\\nfrom the minutes and cited in the creative activity support system. Their further\\ndevelopment will therefore be possible. Then, after the reports are published and\\nthe evaluations are received, the values of the ideas are augmented, and they can be\\nfurther developed by making them the topics of the next meeting.\\nCreativity can be represented by using concrete data and modeled by machine\\nlearning in this way by tracing the generation of ideas through to their development.\\nThe idea seems to have something of value at the time of its creation, but it is very\\ndifﬁcult to evaluate, so by presenting it at a meeting and placing it on the top of the\\ndiscussion, the idea of later development will leave the possibility and direction to\\nthe judgment of participants. Of course, depending on the experience and knowledge\\nof the participants, it is also good that the idea creator compares reactions by showing\\nsimilar ideas at meetings attended by other participants.\\nIn this way, by tracing the development process of ideas, it is possible to represent\\ncreativity with concrete data, and it can be modeled by machine learning.\\nThe development of ideas is not necessarily carried out by a speciﬁc individual.\\nCurrently, only the activities of individual users registered in the creative activity\\nsupport system can analyze the development process of the idea in detail, and only by\\ndiscussion, multiple users can develop ideas (whether idea should be developed or not\\ncan involve judgment). However, there are cases where multiple people will integrate\\nand develop ideas that come up separately. It is necessary to analyze collaborative\\nidea development of multiple users in the same way.\\nWhen it becomes possible to predict the creativity of ideas by machine learning,\\nand when multiple ideas to solve the same problem are conceived, it becomes possible\\nto rationally decide which one to develop preferentially. This is done by presenting\\nmultiple ideas at a meeting and by automatically evaluating extracted statements\\nafter discussions.\\nIt is thought that innovation will be accelerated by repeating choices based on the\\ncreativity of the ideas. Innovation cannot be achieved unless it develops ideas to a\\nlevel that can affect society, but it will be possible to efﬁciently use time to carry out\\ncreative activities by considering which ideas to preferentially develop.\\nThis is presently not an era when innovation is generated from a few outstanding\\nideas. However, a plethora of ideas that can create innovation in the future can be'),\n",

True innovation can be achieved by\\ncarefully developing such a profusion of creative ideas.\\nIt might be the case that humans might become more creative through the support\\nof artiﬁcial intelligence. Whether or not creativity itself can be entrusted to artiﬁcial\\nintelligence is a matter that is likely up for debate, but artiﬁcial intelligence can be\\nused in places where humans are not very good and will help humans in various ways,\\nfor example, to discover high-priority items from a large amount of information and\\nmany others.\\nThe thing that humans should do is to record the discussion ﬁrmly and make\\nanalysis possible. After that, we will conduct creative activities based on goals, issues\\nand plans, and keep track of the details as much as possible. I think that recording\\nof activity is very troublesome unless the person taking the record is in the habit of\\ndoing it (such as a person writing a diary every day), but if they are trying to make\\ntheir activities more meaningful and creative, it would be better to adapt to that way.\\n3.5 Future of Creative Meeting\\nSince a meeting is an important means of communication and a place for multiple\\npeople to share ideas, it is natural to try to acquire various knowledge using the\\nminutes, which is the record, as a knowledge source. The more knowledge the par-\\nticipants can earn, the higher value of their meeting can produce. One way to use\\nthe minutes for multiple purposes is a mechanism that creates answers to any ques-\\ntion of the user by combining information obtained from the minutes. This is called\\nan interactive minute. In order to realize the interactive minutes, detailed semantic\\nstructuring of the minutes is necessary, and it is expected to realize advanced artiﬁcial\\nintelligence technology (e.g., question answering system).\\nIn order to facilitate collaborative work, a mechanism called a shared editor has\\nbeen proposed based on the idea that all the participants need to be able to manage\\nany information which everyone is seeing in the shared space. In this mechanism,\\nsince multiple participants write and view the information at the same time, exclusive\\ncontrol and so on need to be devised. Therefore, it is possible to set a writable layer for\\neach participant, make it overlap, and at the same time use the color-coded pointers\\nto grasp the points indicated by each participant.\\nIn the future, pseudo-face-to-face meetings using virtual space will be heavily\\nused. In the meeting, participants are held by wearing a virtual reality headset and\\nvirtually gathering in a place simulating real meeting rooms or halls. There, vari-\\nous materials will be presented using video/audio/3D data, and discussion will be\\ncarried out by voice accompanied by text subtitles. Of course, the minutes will be\\nautomatically created and their summaries will be generated.\\nAn anthropomorphic agent as a facilitator emerges in the virtual space, in some\\ncases proposing to prevent divergence of the discussion. It also proposes to make\\nan appropriate break during the meeting, and extracts keywords that seem to be\\nimportant. The agent then arranges the keywords in order and shows their diagram-'),\n",

It also supports comparisons with past meetings and supports\\nor disapproves the current proposal based on the comparison results.\\nHowever, the main participants of the discussion will still be humans. Human\\ncreativity cannot be imitated sufﬁciently by artiﬁcial intelligence yet. This is because\\nthe current artiﬁcial intelligence is a mechanism to learn from the data. Humans do\\nnot necessarily think based on data. For that reason, there are things that could lead\\nto a mistake, but on the contrary, there is a chance to make a revolutionary idea that\\ncannot be deduced from existing data.\\nBy making a meeting in the virtual space, physical contact becomes difﬁcult,\\nbut the advantage of not having to travel long distances is very great. Moreover,\\nalmost the same situation as the face-to-face meeting is reproduced, so the nuance\\nof words is easily transmitted. Although it is difﬁcult to recognize the face wearing\\nthe headset, appropriate (sometimes deformed) facial expressions are expressed by\\navatars trained by machine learning in advance.\\nAt such a meeting, the technology we developed will maximize its function.\\nThe techniques of analyzing and structuring meeting and discovering knowledge\\nby discussion mining lead the essence of discussion and function for users to look\\nback past discussions efﬁciently. In addition, it is possible to reproduce the discussion\\nas faithfully as possible with the technology that automatically collects and uses\\nvarious data concerning meetings such as a meeting recorder. The contents of past\\ncreative activities are not lost, they are reused appropriately. The gamiﬁed discussion\\nmethod explained in Chap. 4 works not only to improve motivation for discussion but\\nalso to promote qualitative evaluation of the user’s discussion ability. The mechanism\\nfor improving the ability of the discussion will also be described in detail in Chap. 4.\\nReferences\\nJ. Beel, S.

People will not be conﬁdent about their learning and will\\nbecome confused with tenuous instruction. It is necessary to clarify what they can do\\nand what kinds of abilities they can improve. This paper describes a case of evidence-\\nbased education that acquires educational data from students’ study activities and\\nnot only uses the data to enable instructors to check the students’ levels of under-\\nstanding but also improve their levels of performance. Whether a meeting is executed\\nsmoothly and effectively depends on the discussion ability of the participants. Evalu-\\nating participants’ statements in a meeting and giving them feedback can effectively\\nhelp them improve their discussion skills. We developed a system for improving the\\ndiscussion skills of participants in a meeting by automatically evaluating statements\\nin the meeting and effectively feeding back the results of the evaluation to them. To\\nevaluate the skills automatically, the system uses both acoustic features and linguis-\\ntic features of statements. It evaluates the way a person speaks, such as their “voice\\nsize,” on the basis of the acoustic features, and it also evaluates the contents of a\\nstatement, such as the “consistency of context,” on the basis of linguistic features.\\nThese features can be obtained from meeting minutes. Since it is difﬁcult to evaluate\\nthe semantic contents of statements such as the “consistency of context,” we built a\\nmachine learning model that uses the features of minutes such as speaker attributes\\nand the relationship of statements. We implemented the discussion evaluation system\\nand used it in seminars in our laboratory. We also conﬁrmed that the system is effec-\\ntive for improving the discussion skills of meeting participants. Furthermore, with\\nregard to skills that are difﬁcult to evaluate automatically, we adopted a mechanism\\nthat enables participants to mutually evaluate each other by applying a gamiﬁcation\\nmethod.

Evaluating the discussion\\nability of the speaker leads to evaluating the person’s communication ability. As I\\nmentioned at the beginning of this book, the ability to conduct discussions can be\\nsaid to be the essence of communication skills, so having a high discussion capability\\nnecessarily means a high communication skill.\\nTo evaluate discussion ability, we ﬁrst evaluate individual statements and evaluate\\nthe speaker’s abilities based on the evaluation of his/her statements. Our ﬁrst step is\\nto evaluate an individual’s speaking ability.\\nAs explained in Chap. 3, the meeting support system we developed records the\\nstatements of each participant during the meeting as the discussion content including\\nvideo/audio data and text minutes. Therefore, we can automatically evaluate the\\nstatements based on their acoustic features and linguistic features.\\nAt the meeting, participants need to discuss a topic, analyze the story of the\\nother persons’ statements, and communicate their argument in an easy-to-understand\\nmanner. “Pronunciation,” “speech speed,” “pause,” “conciseness,” etc. are mentioned\\nas easy-to-understand way of speaking (Kurihara et al. 2007). Based on this, we set\\neight evaluation indicators. The evaluation indicators are based on acoustic features\\nand those based on linguistic features.\\nThe indicators that evaluate only by acoustic features are as follows:\\nA. V oice size: voice should be large enough for the speaker to hear enough, while\\non the other hand it is better not to be emotional and too loud. Therefore, we\\nmeasure and evaluate the volume [dB] of each statement.\\nB. V oice intonation: speech without intonation is a factor that makes a listener bored.\\nWe measure the height of the voice in the statement (fundamental frequency F0\\ndescribed later) [Hz], and evaluate those with high standard deviation values as\\ngood evaluations.\\nC. Speed of talking: it will be hard to hear even if the statement is too fast or too slow.\\nTherefore, if the speech speed (the number of syllables per hour, the syllable is\\ndescribed later) is within the appropriate range, it is evaluated as good.\\nD. Fluency: speech with a lot of silence and disﬂuency is difﬁcult to understand. A\\ngood evaluation is given to statements with few ﬁlled pauses (vowel extension)\\nsuch as “eh” during speaking and few silence periods of more than 2 seconds.\\nE. Tempo: it seems easy to understand the speech when the emphasized part is clear.\\nIt is effective that the statements are not monotone such as speaking slowly the\\npart that you want to emphasize and setting a pause before the emphasized\\npart. Therefore, the tempo of the statement is evaluated based on the standard\\ndeviation of the speech speed and the number of “pauses” (“pause” is deﬁned\\nas a silence period of less than 2 s).\\nHere, the fundamental frequency (generally written as F0) is a value expressing\\nthe periodicity of sound, which is the acoustic feature quantity that governs the pitch'),\n",

There is periodicity in voiced sound (vibrating the vocal cord), so the\\nreciprocal of that period (basic period) is the fundamental frequency.\\nF0 is a very important index to consider for the intonation of a voice, but (1)\\na speech waveform is quasiperiodic signal (due to quasiperiodicity of vocal fold\\nvibration), periodicity is not clear, (2) speech is mixed with noise, and (3) the range\\nof change of F0 in voiced sounds is difﬁcult to limit because of the wide range.\\nAccurate extraction of F0 is very difﬁcult. Therefore, several estimation methods\\nhave been proposed. The acoustic analysis program called speech signal processing\\ntoolkit (SPTK) has been released ( http://sp-tk.sourceforge.net/), in which an algo-\\nrithm called pitch extraction is implemented to estimate F0.\\nIn addition, the syllable used to calculate the speech speed is a type of segmental\\nunit that separates consecutive voices, and is a group of sounds heard. Typically, it\\nis a voice (group of voices) consisting of one vowel and its vowel alone or with one\\nor more consonants before and after the vowel. In the case of Japanese, syllables\\nmay use a segment unit called a mora (beat) that does not necessarily match. Strictly\\nspeaking, the mora is used instead of a syllable. The main difference between syllable\\nand mora is that the long vowel, the geminate consonant, and the syllabic nasal are\\nintegrated with the preceding vowel in the case of the syllable, but in the case of the\\nmora it is 1 mora.\\nNext, evaluation indicators based on linguistic features are as follows:\\nF. Conciseness: it is easier to understand if the statement is concise. Therefore,\\nfor the sake of conciseness evaluation, we compare the number of syllables of\\nstatements (strictly mora) in the meeting by speech recognition and the number\\nof syllables of the corresponding statements in the minute of the meeting. Since\\nthe secretary describes the content of the statements in summary, if the number\\nof syllables of the statements and the number of syllables of the corresponding\\nstatements of the minute are close, it can be considered that the statements can\\nbe regarded as being concise.\\nG. Relevance with start-up statements: statements should be relevant with the sub-\\nject of discussion as much as possible. If the content of follow-up statements is in\\ncommon with the content of the topic raising statement (i.e., start-up statement),\\nit can be considered that it is relevant with the theme. Therefore, by evaluating\\nthe degree of relevance to the start-up statements (described later), the relevance\\nof statements is evaluated.\\nH. Consistency with parent statements: follow-up statements need to be united or\\nconsistent with their parent statements. In other words, the content of the follow-\\nup statement and the content of its parent statement must be semantically related,\\nso it is important to evaluate the degree of the consistency. We use a machine\\nlearning technique to decide whether the statement is a “consistent statement or\\nnot” which determines the evaluation. The method is described later.\\nWe calculate the degree of relevance between statements in the following way.\\nFirst, we calculate term frequency–inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) values of\\nwords in each statement by using to following formula:'),\n",

If words (generic words) appear\\nin many documents, their IDF values decrease. If words appear only in speciﬁc\\ndocuments, their IDF values raise.\\nUsing the TF-IDF value with each statement of one meeting as one document, we\\nweight the word t with the following formula to obtain the degree of relevance:\\nf(t, d1, d2) /equal1\\n(\\ntf (t, d1)∑\\ns∈d1 tf (s, d1) + tf (t, d2)∑\\ns∈d2 tf (s, d2)\\n)\\n∗ idf (t)\\nFor words that appear commonly in two documents, add that value, subtract the\\nvalue for words that appear only in one side, and sum over all the words. Let this\\nvalue be the degree of relevance between statements. An example of the calculation\\nis shown in Fig. 4.1.\\nIn Fig. 4.1, t1, … t6 are words and d1, d2 are statements. In this example, t1 and t2\\nappear in common, other words appear only in one. For common words, the weighted\\nvalues by the TF-IDF value are summed to 6.0, otherwise the total weighted value\\nby the TF-IDF value is added to 2.5, so the relevance is 6.0 − 2.5 /equal13.5.\\nBy the way, it can be said that inconsistent statements in the discussion are state-\\nments that describe topics that are different from topics up to that point. So, consider\\nhow to categorize follow-up statements as statements deviating from topics or not.\\nLogistic regression analysis described in Chap. 2 is used for this classiﬁcation. In\\nthis case, calculate the probability value that the statement is deviated from the topic,\\nand use this value for the consistency evaluation of the statement. For this purpose,\\nin addition to the linguistic features obtained from the minutes, we use the meta-\\ninformation given to the minutes. The features used in this method are as follows:\\n(1) Features based on linguistic features of statements.\\n– Relevance to parent statement.\\n– Number of sentences of statements.\\n– Number of characters of statements.\\n– Morpheme unigram and morpheme bigram (see Chap. 2).\\n– Presence of subject word and referring word.\\n– Entity Grid (see Chap. 2).'),\n",

There is another way to display feedback including somewhat detailed\\ninformation like the icons and their descriptions shown on the tablet used by all the\\nparticipants. Let me explain each.\\nThe evaluation indicators through using the acoustic features described in the\\nprevious section can automatically calculate the evaluation values and feedback dur-\\ning the meeting. Speciﬁcally, they evaluate in real time each of “voice size,” “voice\\nintonation,” and “speech speed”, and when it is a value lower than a certain threshold\\nvalue, that is, a “bad” evaluation value, the system pops up a warning message imme-\\ndiately on the main screen (normally displaying the presentation slide) as shown at\\nthe bottom right of Fig. 4.4. This display will be hidden after 2 s.\\nIn order to measure the effect of this simple direct feedback on participants, we\\nevaluated the participants’ “voice size,” “voice intonation,” and “speech speed” at\\nﬁve meetings. Results of examining the change in the evaluation values are shown in\\nFig. 4.5. For “voice size,” the message to be displayed differs depending on whether\\nthe evaluation value is smaller or smaller than the reference value. Regarding “speech\\nspeed,” it may be faster or slower than the reference value, but in the preliminary\\nexperiments, it was extremely rare when it was later than the reference value, and it'),\n",

Only when the evaluation\\nvalue is larger than the reference value, the message is displayed.\\nImprovement numbers shown in Fig. 4.5 are counted as the total number of\\nimprovements for all participants. Improvement means that the evaluation value\\nconcerning the indicator of a certain participant becomes better after a message on\\nthe indicator is displayed while the same person is speaking or immediately after\\nspeaking. The improvement rate is the number of improvements for a certain indica-\\ntor divided by the total number of messages in the indicator. In the ﬁve meetings, we\\ncould not collect sufﬁcient data, but we found trends of improvement by feedbacking\\nthe evaluation results of the statements based on the acoustic features in real time.\\nIn addition to the main screen, there are two subscreens for displaying meeting\\nmetadata in discussion mining so that participants can view one of them at any time\\nduring the meeting. In addition to the statement content (summary) described by\\nthe secretary, the tree structure of the discussion currently being created and the\\nreservation status of the statements are displayed.'),\n",

However, since it is very difﬁcult to enter all the contents of the\\nstatements, it is inevitably the way that the secretary enters while summarizing the\\nstatements. We assume that summarization ability is an approximation of the ability\\nof understanding discussions.\\nThe evaluation indicator of the summarization ability is not mere description\\nquantity. Even if a person with a fast keyboard input can enter many characters in a\\nshort time, it does not mean that their summarization ability is high. Besides that, it\\nis said that a person who enters only the contents considered necessary and does not\\ninput contents judged to be redundant is more summarized.\\nSo, we conducted an experiment to check the following items on the text of the\\nstatements entered by the secretary (Tsuchida et al. 2010).\\n(1) Individual differences in description quantities by secretary.\\n(2) Relationship between the type of discussion and the description quantity.\\nIn this experiment, we used the discussion content which the six undergraduate and\\ngraduate students of our laboratory created for the discussion content, we compared\\nthe statement text (hereinafter referred to as the secretary text) entered by the secretary\\nand the full spoken text (hereinafter referred to as transcription text) which was\\ngenerated by using the speech recognition of the meeting recorder and then corrected\\nfor recognition errors by humans in terms of the proportion of keywords.\\nTo take account of individual differences in the written amount of words by the\\nsecretary, we sorted six secretaries into three groups (two each for each) according\\nto the average number of input characters per statement. Groups A, B, and C are\\ngrouped from the order of the average number of input characters. And, we chose\\ntwo contents for each secretary in charge. In other words, we targeted 2 discussion\\ncontents for each secretary, 4 for each group, and 12 discussion contents overall.\\nThe total number of statements included in all discussion contents was 661 state-\\nments (55.1 statements per meeting), and the total number of discussion chunks\\n(discussion trees with start-up statements as the root) was 137 (11.4 per meeting).\\nThe speech recognition results of the discussion content include speech disﬂuency\\nsuch as “um” and “ah,” but it is deleted in the transcription text. Next, in order to\\nobtain the proportion of keywords in statement texts, morphological analysis was\\nperformed on each secretary text and transcription text. The type and number of\\nparts of speech included in the result are shown in Fig. 4.11.\\nThe TF-IDF value as described above was calculated using a self-contained word\\n(a word making a meaning by itself) obtained by morphological analysis as a keyword\\ncandidate, and one having a threshold value or more was taken as a keyword of a\\nstatement.\\nThe total number of characters in the discussion content used in this experiment\\nwas 41,946 characters (3495 characters per meeting) in the secretary text and 188,816\\ncharacters in the transcription text (15,734 characters per meeting).

Also, from the graph of the reduction rate (2)/(1), it can be seen that\\nthere is a possibility that the secretary with few average input characters may have\\nentered the secretary text more concisely compared to the secretary that has many.\\nIn other words, while a secretary with many average input characters was trying to\\ndescribe the details of the speaker’s speech as much as possible, the secretary with\\na small average number of input characters was thought to have entered input while\\nparaphrasing the speech content as short as possible.\\nAt the meeting, there are various types such as discussion with only question\\nand answer, discussion such as argument on a certain subject like brainstorming.\\nTherefore, for example, if a meeting has a seminar style that includes a question\\nand answer session, a questioner can refer to a presentation slide, so it is easier to\\nunderstand the meaning and it is easy to create a secretary text. On the other hand, a\\ndiscussion including conceptual opinions which cannot be referenced easily through\\nmaterials can be difﬁcult to understand, which makes it difﬁcult to create a secretary\\ntext. It seems that there is a relation between the discussion type and the description\\nquantity of the secretary text.\\nFor this reason, a transcription ratio and a grasping rate are calculated for discus-\\nsion chunks within each discussion content, a reference value SS\\ni expressed by the\\nfollowing equation is calculated for each value, and these tendencies are compared.\\nWhere Xi is the value of X (X is the transcription rate or the grasping rate), E[X]i s\\nthe arithmetic average of X, and SD[ X] is the standard deviation of X.\\nSSi /equal1Xi − E[X]\\nSD[X]\\nThe result is shown in Fig. 4.14.

When we examine this discussion chunk in detail, we found out that it is a\\ndiscussion about the ﬁgure in the presentation slide. In such a case, since the partici-\\npants are pointing at the ﬁgure while speaking, there was a tendency to frequently use\\nreferring words. Therefore, while the secretary often inputs a word that supplements\\nthe contents of the referring words, it was found that the grasping rate decreases\\nbecause the words are not directly included in the speech content.'),\n",

This solves the problem of the reference to the slide,\\nso there is no big difference in the description amount of the secretary by the type of\\ndiscussion.\\nAs there is no dependence on the discussion type and the amount of description\\nof the secretary, the summarization ability can be deﬁned as generically as possible\\nregardless of the content of the meeting. As mentioned earlier, it is considered that\\nthere are three types of individual differences that are likely to occur such as the\\ntranscription rate, the grasping rate, and the reduction rate.\\nTherefore, we will use these three values as indicators of the summarization ability\\n(i.e., listening ability) of the corresponding secretary. Each time the meeting is over,\\nthese values are calculated and fed back to the participants in charge of the secretary.\\n4.4 Discussion Skills Training\\nWell, in this chapter, to evaluate the discussion ability, we have considered the ability\\nto make statements as a speaking ability, the ability to summarize statements as a\\nlistening ability as its constituent elements. Of course, we need to consider other\\nabilities as well, but we focus on discussion ability based on automatically evaluable\\nindices and give feedback to meeting participants quickly. This is to make it possible\\nfor each participant to give better results at the next opportunity based on the feedback.\\nAny training starts with grasping your current state ﬁrst. And, by being conscious\\nof the current state, the direction of the effort will be decided. Like sports, we improve\\nby accumulating practice. In the case of discussion, at the meeting, the participants\\nmake as many statements as possible and make sure that the value of the speaking\\nability is raised. Also, when the participants are responsible for acting as the secretary,\\nthey should act as a secretary with consciousness to increase the value of the indicators\\nof their listening ability.\\nBy the way, our laboratory decides the scores of the seminar based on the data\\nobtained by the discussion mining system (Nagao et al. 2015). However, since we\\nare now thinking of evaluating the process in terms of effort rather than the result,\\nwe evaluate the quantity more than the quality of the statements, so it is not always\\nnecessary for the outstanding grades to have a particularly high discussion ability.\\nHowever, the ability of those who are not making efforts will not rise, so people with\\nlow scores clearly have low discussion skills.\\nIn order to train the discussion ability and communication ability, it is necessary to\\nrecord the evaluation results with a considerably long span. Changes in the short-term\\nevaluation results are effective as a clue to evaluate and improve the performance of\\nthe developed system, but it will not be enough to judge whether a person certainly has\\nthat capability. This is similar to the fact that local optimal solutions do not necessarily\\nbecome true optimal solutions in optimizing parameters of machine learning models.'),\n",

The\\ntechnique we developed is useful for clarifying what kind of ability improves what to\\ndo.

Improving this ability is a task\\nthat can be said to be essential for many people. However, if visible growth does not\\nappear, people will get bored with that training. In the next section, I would like to\\nintroduce one approach to that problem.\\n4.5 Gamiﬁcation for Maintaining Motivation to Raise\\nDiscussion Abilities\\nIn recent years, the word gamiﬁcation has begun to be widely used. Gamiﬁcation is\\nsaid to be “movement to incorporate elements of the game into development of social\\nactivities and service applications” (McGonigal 2011). Speciﬁcally, to introduce\\nvarious game elements, such as level and reward, into the system to improve the\\nmotivation to use the system. The concept of gamiﬁcation is not new at all, it has\\nbeen used for various services before. For example, point cards of shops, access\\nranking of blogs, etc. can be regarded as a type of gamiﬁcation. In the beginning\\nof the 2010s, it seems that general methods of utilizing such game elements have\\nbecome generically called gamiﬁcation.\\nMany applications for gamiﬁcation aim to increase the number of times of service\\nused by unspeciﬁed number of users and to improve work efﬁciency, and in most\\ncases, the effect will appear immediately after introduction of gamiﬁcation. However,\\nin the meetings we are targeting, it is still difﬁcult to improve the discussion ability\\nin a short period of time, although it is possible to facilitate activities within a limited\\ntime and temporarily increase motivation. In order for participants to be able to\\nconduct a high-quality discussion, it is necessary to record, evaluate, and support in\\ndetail the process of gradually growing and experiencing.\\nThe gamiﬁcation framework for discussion consists of seven elements as shown\\nin Fig. 4.15. Students unfamiliar with the discussion at the starting point can be\\nmotivated by each game element and ﬁnally reach the point where their discussion\\nability has improved.\\nThe elements of this gamiﬁcation framework are described below.\\n1. Goal\\nThe purpose of the discussion conducted at the university’s laboratory is divided\\ninto two categories: deciding future policies by improving the content of research by\\nexchanging views and improving the student’s discussion ability.'),\n",

We will pay attention to improving student’s\\ndiscussion skills. Therefore, we will make this a ﬁnal goal.\\nAs a goal element to reach the ﬁnal goal step by step, it is possible to decompose\\ndiscussion ability into several components. This decomposed capability has advanced\\nabilities such as “can ﬁnally summarize stories” from basic ability such as “can say\\nwith loud voice” for example. Meeting participants will voluntarily target the ability\\nthey want to improve from the ﬁnely disassembled discussion abilities and aim to\\nimprove their abilities by speaking to achieve each goal element.\\n2. Visualization\\nMeeting participants will be aware of the improvement in capacity and gain a sense\\nof accomplishment by grasping the process of mastering the decomposed discus-\\nsion abilities independently one by one. For that purpose, it is necessary to have a\\nmechanism to inform the improvement of the discussion ability in real time and a\\nmechanism to conﬁrm the degree of improvement of their own ability later.\\n3. Rule\\nAs mentioned in the previous sections, when evaluating the discussion ability auto-\\nmatically, semantic evaluation of the contents of the speech is difﬁcult and only\\nquantitative evaluations such as the number of statements and the volume of voice\\ncan be done in real time. So, we are making semantic evaluations of the content of\\neach other’s statements by participants. Also, instead of evaluating others throughout\\nthe discussion, we evaluate each statement at a time aiming to increase the number\\nof statements. Those that regulate the behavior of such participants are called rules.'),\n",

Design\\nIt is a mechanism to improve the motivation for students to participate by attractive\\ninterfaces and various compensations. By giving a virtual remuneration, it is neces-\\nsary to carefully decide factors that become extrinsic motivation, paying attention\\nnot to signiﬁcantly lower the intrinsic motivation.\\n5. Social\\nWe introduce a mechanism that enables us to check the degree of mastery of discus-\\nsion skills using Web pages, the users compare their abilities and motivate each other\\nto compete. In addition, it is possible to look back on the statements of other par-\\nticipant’s high discussion skills and use them as reference for their own statements.\\nFurthermore, at the end of the meeting, we aim to further motivate competition and\\nsatisfy self-esteem desires by ranking and praising participants who demonstrated\\nexcellent discussion abilities at that time.\\n6. Tutorial\\nFor students who join the meeting for the ﬁrst time belonging to the laboratory, it is\\nnecessary to understand not only the discussion mining system described in Chap. 2,\\nbut also the elements of the new gamiﬁcation, which is a heavy burden. Therefore,\\nto understand how to use each system is also one goal in gamiﬁcation, and we will\\npromote system understanding by presenting detailed guidelines.\\n7. Difﬁculty adjustment\\nThe users are roughly divided into two types: teachers and students. Also, from the\\nviewpoint of discussion ability, among students, there is a big difference between\\nstudents belonging to the laboratory and newly assigned students. By visualizing the\\ndifﬁculty and complexity of the target, participants with a wide range of discussion\\nability will be able to select appropriate targets for themselves.\\nWe will refer to the mechanism that introduced this gamiﬁcation framework for\\ndiscussion as gamiﬁed discussion (GD, for short).\\nThe purpose of GD is to keep motivation to improve the discussion skills of\\nstudents participating in the meeting. In order to evaluate the improvement of the\\ndiscussion ability, manual evaluation information is required besides the information\\nrecorded by discussion mining, but at the same time, by evaluating others during the\\nmeeting, the risk of hindering concentration on the discussion.\\nTherefore, it is necessary to lower the cost of evaluation as much as possible. First,\\nwe will break down discussion ability, which is a comprehensive skill of complex\\nmanners, so that we can evaluate it more concretely.\\nFor example, the Japan Debate Association classiﬁes abilities necessary for dis-\\ncussion or skills acquired by discussion into the following four categories: ( http://\\nwww.debate-association.org/).\\n1. Comprehension ability.\\n2. Analytical ability.\\n3. Constitutional ability.'),\n",

Transmission ability.\\nComprehension ability is the ability to understand the background of the agenda, the\\ncontent and the intention of the statements by the participants. Analytical ability is\\nthe ability to analyze whether there is contradiction or ambiguity in the participant’s\\nstatements after understanding the contents of the discussion. Constitutional ability\\nis the ability to constitute its own statement content so that it is easy to understand and\\nconvincing. Transmission ability is the ability to devise ideas for speech, attitudes,\\ngestures, etc. so that the other participants can easily understand.\\nIn addition, participants in the meeting using the discussion mining system must\\nhave the ability to reserve the statement and to select the object in the slide by the\\noperation of the discussion commander. In order to conduct a discussion without\\ndelay, it is necessary to perform these operations accurately and smoothly, so we\\ndecided to classify the ability to deal with systems related to discussion mining as\\none class of discussion skills. This is called DM ability, and the abilities belonging to\\nthe DM ability category such as “I can speak without spending time to reservation”\\nand “speak by referring elements on the screen” have been newly added.\\nAs discussion abilities, there are many inclusion relationships such as “I can say\\nopinions” and “I can say brieﬂy”. Therefore, we investigated whether there is an\\ninclusion relation among all the discussion abilities, set the ability to be a subset\\nof the two abilities in inclusion relation as a lower level ability, and make the other\\nthe higher level ability. Based on this, we created a graph in which each discussion\\nability is a node and nodes of two abilities in inclusion relation are linked by links.\\nA part of it is shown in Fig. 4.16.

Therefore, we use the process of acquiring each subdivided ability as a goal\\nelement in gamiﬁcation.\\nThe automatic evaluation of the discussion ability described in previous sections\\nwas to evaluate whether the way of speaking was appropriate or whether the content\\nbeing talked was appropriate, but the evaluation of the discussion ability in GD is\\nperformed by evaluating the achievement degree of a discussion goal set by one\\nparticipant by another participant. These are considered to evaluate different aspects\\nof discussion skills. The latter is more difﬁcult to evaluate automatically because\\nthere are no clear evaluation criteria. In other words, since the methods based on\\nautomatic recognition are suitable for automated evaluation, no human evaluator is\\nnecessary, but GD is a method in which multiple participants mutually evaluate their\\nstatements during discussion.\\nIn order to minimize the burden on the evaluator, the speaker sets only one of the\\ndiscussion abilities (goal elements) as a target, while the other participants who are\\nthe evaluators listen to the statements and evaluate only with respect to one goal. The\\nmeeting participants access the Web page called Personal Page as shown in Fig. 4.17\\nbeforehand and set targets while checking the discussion ability graphs, categories\\nof each ability and acquisition difﬁculty level.\\nWe also created an evaluation interface to evaluate the speaker’s goal during the\\nmeeting as shown in Fig. 4.18.

In\\naddition, our physical–digital learning environment will be further enhanced with a\\nvision system that will detect interactions with the digital poster presentation system\\nand the different discussion tools enabling a more automated skill evaluation and\\ndiscussion mining presented in Chap. 2.\\nAs I mentioned earlier, a lot of attention has been paid to evidence-based research,\\nsuch as life-logging (Sellen and Whittaker 2010) or big data applications (Armstrong\\n2014), that proposes techniques to raise the quality of human life by storing and\\nanalyzing data of daily activities in large quantities. This technique has been applied\\nin the education sector, but a key method has not been found yet because it is generally\\nhard to record intellectual activities, accumulate, and analyze data in a large scale,\\nand compare it with things like a person’s physical activities, position, and movement\\ninformation. Although there are some recent studies on the automated recording of\\nintellectual activities in more detail, their techniques are not sufﬁcient to be applied\\nto an automated evaluation of a person’s intellectual activities. Thus, this study aims\\nto develop a new environment to empower the skills of students not only in real time\\nbut also ofﬂine based on the abundant presentation and discussion data analyses.\\nOur study focuses on the new graduate leading program of Nagoya University that\\naims to cultivate future industrial science leaders. This leading graduate program has\\na new physical–digital environment for facilitating presentations and discussions\\namong the selected students of the program. In particular, the presentations and\\ndiscussions of the students are recorded in detail, and the mechanism of knowledge\\nemergence is analyzed based on a discussion mining system.

There is great signiﬁcance in analyzing discussion in a scientiﬁc way\\nand evaluating its quality. Therefore, we proposed and implemented a method for\\nevaluating the discussion ability of students in meetings in a university laboratory\\nsetting. There are roughly two kinds of evaluation methods as mentioned in Chap. 4:\\n(1) One based on acoustic information, that is, the manner of speaking.\\n(2) One based on language information, that is, the contents of speech.\\nMethod (1) evaluates the appropriateness of utterances in a discussion by using\\nthe acoustic characteristics of speech. The characteristics are automatically evaluated\\nin real time and fed back to speakers during a meeting. For example, we measure\\nthe voice size (loudness), voice intonation, speech speed, ﬂuency, tempo, and other\\nvocal aspects of a speaker and automatically evaluate the acoustic appropriateness\\nof the statements. If anything is determined to be inappropriate, the system provides\\nfeedback to the speaker in several ways, such as with a message popping up on a\\nscreen.\\nMethod (2) analyzes linguistic characteristics in consideration of context. For\\nexample, we estimate the consistency of the context of statements by using machine\\nlearning techniques. Then, the linguistic appropriateness of the statements is auto-\\nmatically evaluated.\\nWe believe that carefully examining these methods over a period of time will\\nresult in a more detailed analysis that helps us focus on more appropriate training\\nfor students.\\nStudents’ improvement in discussion ability is evaluated in subsequent training.\\nDiscussion–skill training is carried out through a repeat cycle that consists of notify-\\ning a person of a problem and giving advice via e-mail prior to a meeting, evaluating\\nstatements during the meeting, and the person reﬂecting and making improvements\\nafter the meeting.\\nThis section reviews other methods for discussion evaluation including online\\ndiscussions such as text discussion on bulletin boards.\\nWith the abundant data in discussions, there is difﬁculty in searching for good qual-\\nity posts. An automatic rating of postings in online discussion forums was presented\\nbased on a set of metrics (Wanas et al. 2008). This set of metrics was used to assess'),\n",

With these metrics used\\nto train a nonlinear support vector machine classiﬁer, the posts were then categorized\\nto their corresponding levels (High, Medium, or Low).\\nAnother system called Auto-Assessor used natural language processing tools to\\nassess the responses of students to short-answer questions (Cutrone et al. 2011).\\nThe system utilized a component-based architecture with a text preprocessing phase\\nand a word/synonym matching phase to automate the marking process. In their\\nsystem evaluation, they compared the assessment results of the Auto-Assessor and\\nHuman Graders to verify the possibility of applying the proposed system in practical\\nsituations.\\nHowever, these fully automatic systems still have some drawbacks. Some methods\\nare language independent resulting in poor performance in relevance and originality\\n(Wanas et al. 2008); thus, other additional techniques should be employed in their\\nassessment of discussions. Also, even with additional NLP techniques, the weights\\ngiven to words are not varied (Cutrone et al. 2011) hindering the system from iden-\\ntifying words that are more signiﬁcant than others.\\n5.2.1.2 Semi-automatic\\nAside from fully automatic systems, some studies employed a semi-automatic\\napproach. One such study is the implementation of a group discussion evaluation\\nmethod and a discussion evaluation support system that focused on ex-post evalua-\\ntion (Omori et al. 2006). The system provided a Web-based interface to display the\\nevaluation item and the evaluation criteria so that users can easily make a score to\\neach of the discussion remarks based on clearness of remarks, proposal of issues, and\\nlogicality of remarks. Results conﬁrmed the effectiveness of both their evaluation\\nmethod and support system.\\nWith the abovementioned systems, there was no mention about one problem in\\ndiscussions, which is the difﬁculty in getting students to actively participate. Thus, a\\ngamiﬁcation framework was integrated into a discussion support system for enhanc-\\ning and sustaining motivation in student discussions (Ohira et al. 2014). Besides\\nsustaining student motivation, the system also evaluates and visualizes improvement\\nof the students’ capacity to discuss. It also supports the users to evaluate the quality\\nof each discussion statement.\\nHowever, with the two semi-automatic systems, more experiments are needed to\\ndetermine the effect of teachers’ feedback to the students (Omori et al. 2006) and its\\nperformance in real-world settings.'),\n",

The system is equipped with a microphone and camera to\\nanalyze the presentation by combining speech and image processing techniques.\\nBased on the results of the analysis, the system provides the speaker with recommen-\\ndations for improving presentation delivery such as speed and audience engagement.\\nDuring the presentation, the system can alert the speaker when some of the indices,\\nspeaking rate, eye contact with the audience, and timing, exceed predeﬁned warning\\nthresholds. After the presentation, the system generates summaries of the analysis\\nresults for the user’s self-examination. Although this system focuses on self-training,\\nit still needs to be tested in a real presentation environment.\\n5.2.2.2 Semi-automatic\\nAnother presentation training system called PitchPerfect was implemented to develop\\nconﬁdence in presentations (Trinh et al. 2014). From interviews with presenters, the\\nauthors uncovered mismatches between best rehearsal practices as recommended in\\nthe presentation literature, the actual rehearsal practices, and support for rehearsal\\nin conventional presentation tool. Thus, they developed the proposed system, an\\nintegrated rehearsal environment that supports users to evaluate their presentation\\nperformance during preparation for structured presentation in PowerPoint. Their user\\nstudy with 12 participants demonstrated that PitchPerfect led to small but signiﬁcant\\nimprovements in perceived presentation quality and coverage of prepared content\\nafter a single hour of use, arising from more effective support for the presenter’s\\ncontent mastery, time management, and conﬁdence building.\\n5.2.3 Motivation\\nIn the initial phase of our research, we selected a semi-automatic approach to evaluate\\nthe discussion and presentation. However, our proposed system can acquire several\\nkinds of student activity-related data to make evaluation automated in the near future.\\nWe understand that current technologies that analyze human activity data which are\\nfully automated are still insufﬁcient to realize our purposes so we focused on data\\nacquisition by using our new environment for discussion and presentation.'),\n",

A list of slide\\nthumbnails displayed in the presentation are also shown, and the thumbnail of the\\ncurrently displayed slide is emphasized in the slide list. Speakers can operate the\\nslideshow by selecting the thumbnail in this view using the touch panel.\\nThe discussion segment view shows the information about the discussion segment,\\nwhich contains the current statement. The texts of the start-up statement, which was\\nthe trigger of the discussion, and the parent statement of the current statement (if\\nit is a follow-up statement) are shown at the upper side of this view.

Therefore, we develop a system to retrieve\\nand browse past discussions on time, called the discussion reminder.\\nThere are two concerning issues in the development of the discussion reminder.\\nOne is an accurate understanding of discussion contents, and another issue is the quick\\nretrieval of discussion contents preventing any disruption in the ongoing discussion.\\nUnclear and inadequate sharing of discussion content will inhibit the achievement of a\\nuniformed knowledge level and will lead to misunderstandings and confusion.

Hence, we\\nbelieve that this system would signiﬁcantly change the way of poster presentations.\\n5.5.1 Digital Posters V ersus Regular Posters\\nA digital poster is an interactive multimodal version of regular papers. The advantage\\nof digital posters includes retrieval and reuse of content. However, one of the biggest\\nproblems is portability since a digital poster needs special hardware such as a digital\\nposter panel and these devices cannot be carried elsewhere. Perhaps, in the near\\nfuture, large and thin ﬁlm-type screen devices, such as organic electroluminescence\\ndisplays, will be available and tools for digital posters will be commodities and easily\\nacquired.'),\n",

The users\\nshould prepare resources such as images, videos, and slides in advance. We also\\ndeveloped an online resource management system for memos, images, videos, and\\nslides. The digital poster authoring tool can import any resources submitted or shared\\nin the resource management system.\\nThe digital poster authoring tool shown in Fig. 5.7 has three parts: the main menu,\\nthe resources menu, and the poster ﬁeld.\\nThe main menu provides the basic functionalities of the tool such as creating,\\nopening, and saving of poster ﬁles, setting up the desired preferences, and choosing\\ndifferent creation modes. The digital authoring tool is also able to create both portrait\\nand landscape orientation posters as needed.\\nThe resources menu shown in Fig. 5.8 lets the users add different types of blocks\\nto the poster ﬁeld. Each block automatically downloads a certain type of resource\\ndepending on the selected block from the online resource management system, except\\nfor the layout and text blocks. Selecting an image block will automatically scan\\nfor images in the resource management system, while selecting a video block will\\nautomatically scan for videos in the resource management system. For the slide\\nblock, existing PowerPoint slides will be selected.\\nWhen the user taps a block in the resource menu, a list of thumbnail images is\\ndisplayed in the window that appears from the right edge of the screen as shown in\\nFig. 5.9. The user can easily arrange the layout of the poster using a layout block and\\ninteractively change a position of a block’s borderline. When the user wants to place\\nany resource in the block, he/she should just drag and drop the thumbnail image from\\nthe resource list to the target block as shown in Fig. 5.10.'),\n",

In the Leaders’ Saloon, we employed\\na simpler version of the evaluation method based on statistic data calculated by the\\ndiscussion mining system.\\nData acquired by the discussion mining system includes participant types (pre-\\nsenter, secretary, and others), number of start-up/follow-up statements of each par-\\nticipant, and quality scores for each statement. The quality scores are calculated by\\nthe agreement/disagreement data input by each participant’s discussion commander\\nduring discussions.

The student performance increases if the student makes\\nmany statements when he/she is not the presenter, and many of the other participants\\nalso agree with these statements. It is then possible that these data be a basis to\\nimprove a student’s discussion skills. It can also be conﬁrmed that discussion skills\\nare improved by making high-quality statements, that is, a lot of agreements obtained\\nfrom many participants.\\n5.6.2 Presentation Skills\\nA study on developing oral presentations skills embedded oral presentations and\\nassessment to their curriculum (Kerby and Romine 2009). In their case study, they\\nincluded at least one oral presentation in three of their courses and used a rubric to\\nassess the oral presentations. Their results indicate that students better understood\\ntheir weaknesses, strengths, and areas for improvement with their presentations. In\\nour study, we also implemented the same design to improve the presentation skills\\nof our students. We conducted two poster presentation sessions with two groups\\nof students to evaluate their presentation skills. We used the poster presentation\\nformat instead of the regular oral presentations because of the interactivity of poster\\npresentations. In poster presentations, the students are able to engage in conversation\\nwith people, giving them more opportunities to improve their communication skills.\\nAlso, poster presentations enliven the student presentations because students interact\\nwith each other more instead of just passively observing like in formal presentations.\\nIn the case of oral presentations, we developed a presentation training system in\\na virtual reality environment. The system also works at the Leaders’ Saloon. I will\\nexplain the system at the end of this chapter.\\n5.6.2.1 Poster Presentation Session I\\nIn this poster presentation session, twenty-four (24) inexperienced students were\\ndivided into six (6) groups and each group was asked to create a digital poster using\\nthe authoring tool discussed in Sect. 5.5. Each group presented their posters in the\\nallotted time of ﬁfteen (15) minutes, while members of the other groups and spectators\\nof the poster session evaluated each poster presentation. The evaluation sheet used\\nfor this poster presentation session is shown in Fig. 5.13.\\nEvaluators ﬁll up the feedback form shown in Fig. 5.13 for each presentation. The\\nevaluation criteria include Content, Organization, and Impact.

Spectators of the poster\\nsession were asked to evaluate each poster presentation.\\nWe improved our evaluation criteria based on the encountered problems in the\\nformer trial. Based on feedback from the evaluators, one major drawback in the\\nprevious evaluation sheet shown in Fig. 5.13 is that there are not enough details for\\nthe ratings (Bad, Poor, Fair, Good, and Excellent) under certain criteria. Thus, the\\nevaluation sheet was modiﬁed to a rubric with concrete descriptions for each score\\nand criteria. The new evaluation sheet is shown in Fig. 5.16. Using this rubric style\\nof evaluation, the evaluation criteria were clearer and evaluation time were faster for\\nthe spectators. Aside from changing the evaluation format, the sets of criteria were\\nalso modiﬁed. We added two main sets of criteria: Impact and Presentation.\\nWe added Impact to determine how the poster is able to attract the attention of\\nspectators. It consists of the criteria for evaluating the poster’s title, overall appear-\\nance, and interest. We also added Presentation, another set of criteria for evaluating\\nthe students’ poster presentation skills. It consists of the ability to communicate\\nproperly to their audience and the ability to answer questions conﬁdently. Adding\\nthese new sets of criteria provided a more effective and complete digital poster eval-\\nuation. Using the new evaluation sheet, the score results of the second round of\\nposter presentations are shown in Fig. 5.17. The evaluation scores of the professors\\n(P) and students (S) were calculated. With these results, we were able to determine\\nthe weakness of each poster based on the criteria. For example, with Poster III, its\\ncontent and organization needed a lot of improvement thus for feedback, the author\\nneeds to focus on these sets of criteria when he/she modiﬁes the said poster.'),\n",

However, it is difﬁcult to evaluate\\nthese criteria and we will be incorporating evaluating these movements through the\\nplanned vision system (the virtual reality system mentioned later has a recognition\\nfunction of body movement and gestures). In addition, students’ psychophysiological\\ndata such as heart rate will also be incorporated in our learning evaluation system. A\\ntrial system is explained next. In order to improve the evaluation criteria presented in\\nthe previous section, the automated system is expected to receive real-time evaluation\\nfrom the audience and to provide the presenter with the relative score. The registered\\naudience can input their score to an online sheet with a tablet while attending the\\nposter session. The audio–visual system is also expected to record the visual and\\naudio interactions between the presenter and each audience.

There-\\nfore, there has been increasing focus on observing the correlation between HR data\\nand cognitive activities. A study on measuring the HR during three cognitive tasks\\n(Luque-Casado et al. 2013) revealed the affection of cognitive processing on HRV .\\nThe stress level also has been assessed during Trier social stress test tasks, a type of\\ncognitive activity, by using HR and HRV metrics (Pereira et al. 2017).

However, it is difﬁcult to prepare such a situation\\nin advance. Virtual reality (VR) provides a means for that. In a VR space, you can\\ndisplay a virtual audience who stands on a big stage such as an auditorium, and reacts\\naccording to the content of the presentation and the way of presenter’s speaking.\\nWe developed a VR presentation training system as shown in Fig. 5.22.I nt h i s\\nsystem, based on the acoustic features of the speaker’s voice introduced in Chap. 4\\nand the characteristics analyzing the slide used for the presentation, we control the\\nreaction of the virtual audience. Also, by tracking the movement of the body with\\nthe VR system, we evaluate gaze and gesture and score the presentation. Actions\\nsuch as responding quickly to the reaction of the audience, changing the way of\\nspeaking, changing the display slide, and changing the topic ﬂexibly are also subject\\nto evaluation.\\nSuch a VR training system operates in our smart learning environment. The system\\nincludes contents of VR environments that precisely reproduce institutions such as\\nactual lecture halls and auditoriums, 3D models, and action scripts that visualize\\nthe appearance and reaction of audiences three-dimensionally.

They are acquired by\\ndedicated sensors in addition to the VR system. These data are collected by operating\\na meeting system using VR described below. The audience’s model is accompanied\\nby parameters that adjust the degree and timing of reaction, and ingenuity is given\\nto prevent all people from always showing similar reactions to the same stimulus.\\nFeedback on the presentation is displayed as a reaction of the audience during\\nthe presentation. Also, after the presentation, it is displayed as a score for several\\nfeatures mentioned above and can be browsed at an arbitrary timing together with\\na history of past presentations. The history of the presentation in the VR system is\\nin chronological order of 3D animations with sounds of their own avatar presenting\\nusing slides and other materials.\\nLike the evaluation indicators of the discussion mentioned in Chap. 4, the eval-\\nuation indicators of the presentation are based on acoustic features such as voice\\nsize, intonation, and speech speed and those based on eye contact between presenter\\nand audiences. In addition, the simplicity of the content of presentation materials'),\n",

Although it operates differently from a\\nnormal laser pointer, it can realize almost the same function as the pointing system\\nusing the discussion commander in the discussion mining system described in\\nChap. 2.\\nOf course, this VR presentation system can be used not only for training but also\\nfor meetings such as laboratory seminars. In that case, the audience is not an AI but\\nan actual human avatar, and participation from a remote place is possible. In that\\ncase, human avatar can input gesture using hand trackers, and head movement is also\\nreproduced on VR using HMD.\\nAlso, in the case of a meeting by VR, as in the case of the face-to-face meeting,\\nthe contents can be recorded in detail and used for searching, knowledge discovery,\\nand so on. Since the VR system is equipped with a voice recognition function, it is\\npossible to convert the voice of the speaker into text, and furthermore, by using the\\npointer function by the hand tracker, in addition to the movement of the head and the\\nhand, it is possible to record pointing and referring actions. In this system, since the\\nmeeting participants are wearing the HMD, it is impossible to recognize the facial\\nexpression from the image, but it can be estimated by using the myoelectric sensor\\nbrought into contact with the skin of the face. Information on gestures and facial\\nexpressions of meeting participants are used to construct a machine learning model\\nof reaction of audience AI in the presentation training system.\\nThe machine learning model represents relationships among various data gathered\\nby the presentation training system, the behavior of the audience (raising the face,\\ncranking the neck, laughing, sleeping, hitting the hands, stomping the feet, etc.), and\\nmental conditions of the audience (interested, not interested, pleased, angry, etc.).\\nBased on the relationships, the VR system controls the reaction of audiences. While\\nseeing this reaction, the presenter examines the presentation state (whether it is well\\naccepted by the audience) and considers how to improve the presentation.\\nWe are not conducting subject experiments of this system yet, but we will demon-\\nstrate that students’ presentation skills will improve by operating this VR training\\nsystem for a certain period of time.'),\n",

Symbiosis between humans and artiﬁcial intelli-\\ngence can be said to be a relationship that enhances each other’s abilities. In order\\nto establish such a relationship, one’s learning needs to have a positive inﬂuence\\non the other’s learning. The current mainstream is to advance artiﬁcial intelligence\\nby machine learning based on human-made data. However, if artiﬁcial intelligence\\ncan properly support human learning and human beings can generate useful data\\nfor artiﬁcial intelligence as a byproduct of humans’ main activities, positive circu-\\nlation will be established between human and artiﬁcial intelligence learning. At this\\ntime, artiﬁcial intelligence needs to understand the situation of human beings, sup-\\nport learning, and actively collect data necessary for their learning. Such artiﬁcial\\nintelligence should be an autonomous existence. Indications of autonomous artiﬁ-\\ncial intelligence have already appeared. One example would be a smart speaker like\\nGoogle Home. It usually listens to the human calls silently, and when it is called it\\nresponds to it. However, if a universal pattern is found in human behavior (happen\\nat the same time every day at the same time, sleep at the same time every day, when\\nwe wake up in the morning, ﬁrst check the weather, etc.), artiﬁcial intelligence could\\nalso prefetch human demands and provide information. We need to think about evils\\nwhen such autonomous artiﬁcial intelligence becomes common. It begins with a leak\\nof privacy, which in turn involves human control and management. To ensure that\\nartiﬁcial intelligence does not become a disadvantage to humans, we should estab-\\nlish a symbiotic relationship with artiﬁcial intelligence as soon as possible. In this\\nchapter, I will also discuss that point.\\nKeywords Autonomous artiﬁcial intelligence\\n· Intelligent agent · Chatter bot ·\\nSmart speaker · Singularity · Human–computer symbiosis\\n© Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019\\nK.

Machines will contribute to supplementing\\nhuman memory and judgment because they are good at search based on large amounts\\nof data and prediction based on them.\\nIn the explanation so far, artiﬁcial intelligence is rather playing a backseat role, and\\nit does not claim any self-assertion, but we can think of a way of artiﬁcial intelligence\\nthat is not so. This includes cases where the machine moves away from humans and\\nacts autonomously, for example, a self-driving car that a human driver does not ride.\\nHowever, strictly human control is supposed to be applied and it will be possible\\nto give instructions to artiﬁcial intelligence by remote control. The machine acts\\nautonomously if human instructions do not make it in time or it cannot be instructed\\nby human ability in the ﬁrst place.\\nSuch autonomous artiﬁcial intelligence may become a dangerous existence. How-\\never, it is not a rebellion of artiﬁcial intelligence, as is told in science ﬁction novels.\\nIn my opinion, the rebellion of artiﬁcial intelligence (an event that looks like it) is\\nmostly caused by human error (or negligence); I think that it can prevent recurrence.\\nIn other words, I think that artiﬁcial intelligence does not directly harm humans by\\ntheir own judgment (prediction acquired from data). For example, it cannot be said\\nthat there are no cases where a person dies due to judgment of artiﬁcial intelligence,\\nsuch as a death by accident from self-driving car, but it is not a case that artiﬁcial\\nintelligence acts to killing humans, I think that it is caused by unfortunate coincidence\\nbecause it is impossible to predict everything that could happen.\\nThe real danger lies in losing one’s drive for self-improvement due to reliance\\non artiﬁcial intelligence. Many people often point to Japan’s adoption of “Y utori\\neducation” (relaxed education) as being a cause of the declining scholastic ability in\\nstudents. However, I believe that the main cause lies in IT devices and applications\\ntypiﬁed by smartphones giving children a groundless sense of knowing everything,\\nwhich leads to their abandoning efforts to learn by themselves. For example, a modern\\nchild might wonder what is the purpose of ﬁnding out something on my own, when I\\ncan just search for anything I am interested in and ﬁnd it easily. As a result, we now\\nsee that the number of young people with low adaptability and lacking fundamental\\nability has increased.\\nAnyway, what I would like to claim in this book is that humans cannot adapt to the\\nnew society unless efforts continue in the future, and that artiﬁcial intelligence has\\nthe ability to properly support them. There, we can ﬁnd out the way of new symbiosis\\nof man and machine.\\nI think that what we should consider to expand human ability is what something\\nhumans cannot replace with machines. Things that have been very difﬁcult to auto-\\nmate until now are gradually becoming feasible by collecting and analyzing large\\namounts of data that measured the phenomena. It is the stance of this manual that\\nit is not appropriate to let a machine’s intellectual creation activities act on behalf\\nof machines, but still I think that someday humans will leave many parts of intel-'),\n",

I believe that humans will always be able to create new data from creative\\nactivities, as long as they strive diligently to do so. However, as long as artiﬁcial\\nintelligence is always based on historical data, it seems that what they produce will\\nbe a repetition of similar things. Humans always seek new things. Therefore, we can\\ncreate something new. There is also the term “warm innovation.” Therefore, depend-\\ning on the ﬁeld, there is a possibility that new data can be created by analyzing past\\ndata well. However, I think that creative activities have more than what is obtained\\nfrom historical data.\\nThe machine learning model and the human brain structure are actually quite\\ndifferent. The neural network that machine learning (especially deep learning) uses\\nis originally made with reference to the human brain, but there are few differences\\nbetween what we know about brain mechanisms at that the time and what we currently\\nknow, there is a gap. In terms of the fact that the brain consists of a network of\\nunits called neurons, it is similar to the machine learning model, but its input/output\\nrelationship is very different.\\nThe relationship between layers of the neural network in machine learning has no\\nparticular meaning. It only speciﬁes a nonlinear function to compute parameters. It\\nis said that neurons of the human brain always output forecast values (Hawkins and\\nBlakeslee 2005). This means that upon receiving a signal in one state, it will output\\na signal in a later state in time. For example, when listening to a song, the neuron\\nis predicting the next note. Also, when getting off the stairs, neurons are predicting\\nwhen the foot will touch the next area. When throwing the ball to someone else,\\nthe neuron is predicting that the ball will approach the other person. Of course,\\nthe neuron sees only one element when expressing a phenomenon in a distributed\\nrepresentation (vector expression), but still predicts the next state of the element. In\\naddition, context information is used for prediction, but its description is somewhat\\ncomplicated, so I omit it here.\\nIncidentally, there is an illusion of the eye to a phenomenon famous for human\\nvision (the same line of length looks like a different length, a parallel line looks\\nbent, etc.). This phenomenon is recognized by the human brain as always making\\nforecasts, as initially recognized as predicted, but it is found that the prediction is\\nincorrect while doing some operation, such as drawing an extension line. It seems\\nto be seen correctly. It is probably due to such a brain’s work that you can see\\nsomething that should not exist, or you can hear sounds that cannot be heard (which'),\n",

Naturally, this is not all bad; due to the\\nbrain’s forecasting mechanism, recognition has been accelerated and balanced with\\nbehavior.\\nAnyway, what I want to say is that artiﬁcial intelligence and the human brain\\nstructure are currently different. So, the way creativity comes up is different. We\\ncannot fully automate our creative activities with machines so far, but we can make\\ngood use of each other’s characteristics to make it more sophisticated and efﬁcient.\\nThis is considered as “ augmentation of human ability” in this book.\\nAugmentation of human ability on the premise of artiﬁcial intelligence is to make\\nhuman and machines work properly, and they are closely related to each other so\\nthat humans can achieve greater results than by themselves. Alternatively, it solves\\nproblems that cannot be solved by humans alone. Problems that are difﬁcult to solve\\ninclude not only that it is difﬁcult to solve but also problems that cannot be solved\\nwithin a limited time, even if you can afford it if you have time to spare. For example,\\nit would be a problem for me to decide what roads I will walk within a few seconds.\\nHumans must properly communicate their intention (goal) and current state of\\ntheir actions to the machine. One of Google’s founders who swept the world with\\nsearch engines said that “searching is an act of communicating what people want to\\ndo or things they are interested into machines.” When we live in this era, when we\\nhave something to worry about, we immediately started searching the net (inputting\\nkeywords into Web search engines) using PCs and smartphones. I do not think that is\\na bad thing, but it is not a creative activity if it is completed by the act of investigating.\\nI hope to make a habit of utilizing the retrieved results for subsequent activities and\\ncommunicating the results to the machine again.\\nEven if the act of communicating your intention is a daily search, we still must\\ncommunicate our current state to the machine. Even if we understand human inten-\\ntions, if we do not know the state of the human, the machine cannot predict what\\npeople should do. For example, when considering directions on a map, the destina-\\ntion alone is insufﬁcient and it is necessary to know the current position (or departure\\npoint). There are various ways the machine knows the current state of humans. One\\nway to do this is pattern recognition such as image recognition and speech recogni-\\ntion, as explained in Chap. 3. In addition, there is a way to estimate the current state\\nusing past history. Pattern recognition as well as estimation from history is current\\nareas of artiﬁcial intelligence, that is, because machine learning works effectively.\\nEspecially pattern recognition processes information of the real world (our living\\nphysical world). For that purpose, we use a device called a sensor (a camera and\\na microphone). And, as a matter of course, information that can be used (input)\\nbecomes more diverse as more sensors are added. The sensors we are currently\\npaying attention to are three-dimensional sensors and biosensors (sensors that detect\\nbiological signals). Three-dimensional sensors are used by machines to learn more\\nabout the physical space around humans. In addition, the biosensor is used by the\\nmachine to know the internal state of humans (tired, feeling good, etc.).\\nAlso, machines will be able to recognize what people are watching, what they\\nare listening to, and even voices. By processing such a wide variety of data (called'),\n",

And when\\nyou know the human intention and state, artiﬁcial intelligence will predict human\\nbehavior and give us insight.\\nWhether humans adhere to that advice or not, perhaps humans can do more than\\nnow. It is because humans are not good at objectively monitoring their state (espe-\\ncially internal state), as they are often conscious only after being told by others. In\\ngeneral, the humans brain does not work well when he or she just woke up. Likewise,\\nthere are things that humans can do well and things that cannot be done properly\\ndepending on their condition. By choosing the most successful actions in the current\\nstate, humans will be much better at using time. That means exactly that human\\ncapabilities will be expanded.\\nJust as artiﬁcial intelligence is useful for improving speciﬁc skills such as discus-\\nsions, the skills of various creative activities will be improved appropriately with the\\nsupport of artiﬁcial intelligence. The author cannot conﬁrm the effectiveness of all\\nabilities, but we feel that we probably have a rough idea of the things that humans\\nmust do in the future. Humans will continue their creative activities in the future,\\ncontinue to make new ones, and to successfully use artiﬁcial intelligence as a tool,\\nso that humans devise to give as much data as possible to artiﬁcial intelligence.\\n6.2 Intelligent Agents\\nAn artiﬁcial intelligence system actively acting on humans is called an intelligent\\nagent. Intelligent agents can act actively on their own goals. Therefore, for humans,\\nI think that it can be felt as a system with some personality. However, the personality\\nis not naturally occurring; it is just made to imitate the behavior of humans, and it is\\nperhaps better to call it a pseudo-personality. Since it is not clear how to generate self-\\nconsciousness, it is only possible to imitate it. Nevertheless, there is great signiﬁcance\\nin humans recognizing an agent as being a person and treating them as such.\\nThis is because humans can interact with it in a way they do not normally inter-\\nact with machines. That is by way of speaking. In Chap. 3, I explained the speech\\nrecognition function installed in the meeting recorder, but in this system, artiﬁcial\\nintelligence is listening to what humans are talking about, for the purpose of prepar-\\ning the minutes. It is, of course, an important function, but unlike an intelligent\\nagent, it was not something that actively encouraged humans. The agent listens to\\nhuman words in order to return some response to humans. In other words, it is very\\nappreciated by the humans to talk to the agent.\\nA typical example of such a system would be called a chatter bot. This works on\\na system of sending short messages like Twitter in a textual interactive system that\\nexists on the net. In that case, it interrupts when people are chatting with each other\\nand delivers messages to unspeciﬁed people. Some are running with the intention\\nof deceiving humans, and others have data collection purpose to understand human\\nlanguage. However, as of now, there seems to be no chatter bot that is wise enough\\nto successfully deceive many people.'),\n",
              " Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Artificial Intelligence Accelerates Human Learning_ Discussion Data Analytics ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'page': 146}, page_content='140 6 Symbiosis between Humans and Artiﬁcial Intelligence\\nThere is a system called ELIZA which can be called the ancestor of the chatter bot\\n(Weizenbaum 1966). ELIZA is a system created by Joseph Weizenbaum in 1966 and\\ninteracts with humans like a counselor. For example, if a human says, “my head hurts,”\\nELIZA returns with “Why do you say your head hurts?”. And if he or she says, “my\\nmother hates me,” ELIZA returns “does anyone in your family and others dislikes\\nyou?”. ELIZA seems to mimic the reaction of a psychotherapist in a psychiatric\\ninterview. Weizenbaum chose psychotherapy to avoid the problem of having the\\nsystem data on real-world knowledge. Although the situation of psychotherapy is a\\ndialogue between humans, there is a characteristic that almost no knowledge about\\nthe content of the dialogue is required. For example, even if a human asked “who is\\nyour favorite composer?”, ELIZA can return “who is your favorite composer?” or\\n“is that question important?”. It seems to be because the dialogue system does not\\nneed knowledge about the composer.\\nAlthough a chatter bot is a good partner to kill time chatting with, it is not enough to\\nexpand human ability, so there is need for more speciﬁc intelligence. As an example\\nof such a system, there is a spoken dialogue robot that the authors previously created\\n(Nagao 2002). As shown in Fig. 6.1, this robot has a face and responds variously\\naccording to human speech. In some cases, images and images are displayed on the\\nnearby display, and they refer to it and explain by voice. This was made in 2000, at\\nthat time, the mechanism of machine learning was not implemented. Therefore, the\\ntypes of questions that can be answered were quite limited. In other words, the robot\\ncould not learn words and knowledge while talking to humans.\\nMeanwhile, recently, there is a smart speaker in an agent-like system which is\\nattracting much attention. Starting with Amazon Echo, Amazon launched in 2014,\\nGoogle released Google Home in 2017, and Apple released HomePod in 2018.\\nFigure 6.2 shows the appearance of each product.\\nIf it is placed somewhere in the room, it will retrieve information and manipulate\\nappliances such as lighting and air conditioning according to human calls. Also,\\nsince it is a system for playing music, it will play when you request a favorite song.\\nBoth the smartphone and the PC operated by touching directly, the distance from the\\nmachine becomes a more freeing by being able to operate it by voice. Of course, there\\nwas a mechanism to remotely control home appliances, but it was necessary to use a\\nmachine (remote control) for that. Since voice can be sent without using tools, there\\nare some deﬁnite merits. For example, it is not necessary to remember the procedure\\nfor operating the machine, and you can pay attention only to the operation. In other\\nwords, you can directly input requests like “I want to know…” and “what is…?”.\\nThis is something the researchers of speech recognition have been saying for quite\\na while but ﬁnally it is becoming a reality. For agents, it is a very important function\\nto interact with humans, so it is inevitable that agents become more sophisticated\\nwith the development of spoken dialogue technology.\\nBy the way, the biggest difference between the above-spoken dialogue robot and\\nthe recent smart speakers is not just whether there is a face. The real difference lies\\nin whether the intelligence system is in the machine before your eyes or whether it\\nexists somewhere else. The mechanism of doing a speciﬁc service on the Internet\\nis called the cloud, but for smart speakers, the body of intelligence is in the cloud.'),\n",

As I have said so far, for machine learning, in most cases, it\\nis advantageous to have as much data as possible. Since the cloud can connect with\\nvarious machines, the incoming data will be much more than a single machine.\\nThere is not an appropriate place to realize artiﬁcial intelligence as much as the\\ncloud, but there are some evils caused by it. That is, the human’s live voice (in some\\ncases, including the surrounding video data) is sent to the cloud. For learning, it is\\nbetter to input the signal of the real world itself, but of course it may be a problem.\\nIndividuals have privacy. Privacy is a complex concept, in short, it can be said\\nthat freedom not to disclose personal life information about individuals and freedom\\nthat does not receive interference of others against individual activities. However,\\nunintentionally information on privacy may be leaked to the outside. If it is due to\\na person’s mistake, such as what happened due to incorrectly setting the disclosure\\nrange of information posted to SNS, it likely cannot be helped. However, in many\\ncases, it is not always the responsibility of the person himself/herself that the problem\\noccurs. Many of the issues come from the cloud.\\nThe problem with smart speakers is that some of the conversations you usually\\ntalk about are sent to the cloud. It is used as learning data, but it can be used for other\\npurposes as well. For example, it is a clue to estimate the user’s daily behavior and\\nliving standards. It may be used as evidence to identify a criminal. In fact, there was\\na case where Amazon requested that the American court submit data of a certain\\nuser’s voice obtained by Amazon Echo as evidence (although Amazon refused the\\nrequest).\\nThis problem is a new problem born with the advancement of technology, and it\\nseems that problems similar to this will occur from now on. In 2013, Edward Snow-\\nden accused the US government of collecting personal information gathered. It is a\\nso-called “Snowden Incident”. In this way, thinking that collecting and analyzing per-\\nsonal information for the purpose of maintaining public security is a sufﬁcient story,\\nirrespective of its compliance. I do not use SNS and do not unnecessarily disclose\\npersonal information. Still, it will be difﬁcult to prevent things like getting involved\\nin some kind of trouble and unfairly exposing personal information. By the way, con-\\ncerning the relationship between privacy and technology, Ann Cavoukian advocates\\nthe concept of Privacy by Design (Cavoukian 2011). She insists that in designing\\nand operating an information system, personal information should be controlled by\\nindividuals (such as limiting the scope of disclosure and use).\\nWhen using the cloud, there is a possible way to do something and send data with\\ncare so as not to leak personal information. In that case, the mechanism of intelligence\\nis distributed among machines and clouds that users directly use. In other words, it\\nmeans that machines used by individuals also have some intelligence. Such a way\\nof thinking is called edge intelligence. Edge refers to the end of the network. For\\nthat, we need to be able to use machine learning to a certain extent even with a small\\namount of data. In this case, the mechanism of deep learning may not be necessarily\\neffective, but logistic regression analysis and active learning such as explained in\\nChap. 2 will function effectively.'),\n",

However, the agent will help the\\nwork done by humans, but it will not take over. There is a possibility that the agent\\nwill be in charge of some part of your work, but you will not be able to delegate\\neverything. The agent is an autonomous system, but it is not a self-contained system.\\nThe agent is designed to be a human support system to the end; it must be such that\\nit operates under the control of humans. It is an essential requirement for agents to\\ncoexist with humans.\\n6.3 Singularity\\nA phenomenon called the singularity or the technological singularity thought to be\\na possible outcome of the development of artiﬁcial intelligence has been widely\\ndiscussed (Kurzweil 2005). Current artiﬁcial intelligence cannot be said to have the\\nsame intelligence as humans, but it is certain that progress is accelerating due to\\nthe large concentration of data in the cloud and technologies like deep learning. It\\nis predicted that when artiﬁcial intelligence surpasses human intelligence and leads\\ntechnical advancement it will bring about a rapid and large change that cannot be\\nunderstood at the speed of human thought. This is a phenomenon called the singularity\\n(to be precise at the time that the phenomenon occurs), but I do not know if this is a\\ncorrect prediction or not. Also, I think that considering the singularity as a precursor\\nof artiﬁcial intelligence against humans is not a very appropriate way of thinking.\\nI think that it is natural that human life will change by advancing technology, and\\nnow I think that we as a society depend heavily on IT, especially the Internet. Also,\\nI think that it is no doubt that artiﬁcial intelligence will become more sophisticated,\\nand in certain areas (games such as shogi and go as easy-to-understand examples)\\nwill have much better ability than humans. But still, I do not think that artiﬁcial\\nintelligence will be an omnipotent existence that surpasses humans in every aspect.\\nOf course, artiﬁcial intelligence is obviously advantageous because it is an electronic\\nentity without a physical body. Self-propagation of artiﬁcial intelligence is fully\\nconsidered. However, unless autonomous evolution happens and self-consciousness\\nemerges, it does not seem that it will become threatening humans away from the\\ncontrol of the human who is the designer of artiﬁcial intelligence.\\nIf such a thing happened, it means that the design made by humans was wrong. In\\naddition, although we cannot assert about the possibility of autonomous evolution, I\\nthink that it is impossible for humans to understand the mechanism, which ultimately\\nmakes it impossible to implement. As it happened that the act is properly performed,\\nof course it is possible to repeat similar acts, but I think that such learning of behavior\\nand self-consciousness are not continuous.\\nIf human created design was wrong, it should be modiﬁed by humans. In other\\nwords, even if artiﬁcial intelligence is realized, it is only necessary to realize a\\nmechanism for correcting it and incorporating it in advance. There are people who'),\n",

Humans should become\\nsmarter with the evolution of artiﬁcial intelligence, because I think that a method\\nof properly stopping artiﬁcial intelligence can be implemented for the human who\\ndesigned it.\\nThere is a prediction that artiﬁcial intelligence gets smarter and faster and humans\\ncannot go about it. This prediction seems to ignore the possibility of human efforts,\\nand anyway, I cannot agree with it, regardless of its pros and cons. I think it is\\ninevitable to be overtaken by some people and some abilities. However, I think that\\nartiﬁcial intelligence will never be hostile to humans, as artiﬁcial intelligence keeps\\nthe role of continuing to support the expansion of human capabilities, and as we are\\ncarefully managing it.\\n6.4 Human–AI Symbiosis\\nJ. C. R. Licklider published a paper named Man–Computer Symbiosis in 1960 (Lick-\\nlider 1960). As written in the paper, symbiosis is deﬁned as “living together in inti-\\nmate association, or even close union, of two dissimilar organisms.” In this paper,\\nit is stated as follows. “The hope is that, in not too many years, human brains and\\ncomputing machines will be coupled together very tightly, and that the resulting\\npartnership will think as no human brain has ever thought and process data in a way\\nnot approached by the information-handling machines we know today.”\\nThis can be thought of as connecting the human brain directly to the computer.\\nHowever, what I call “symbiosis of humans and artiﬁcial intelligence” is not a form\\nin which humans and computers are physically coupled. Instead, we assume a form\\nthat is tied in with both senses and language ability.\\nThe reason for assuming in this manner is related to a nature that I call separability.\\nSeparability is a property of whether the work is still feasible in a situation where\\nhumans and machines cooperate and work, if for some reason it allows the human\\nburden to increase even if the machine fails. If a human can execute the work even\\nif the machine stops, it is said he or she can be separated from the machine.\\nAt this point, it would seem that humans are somewhat inseparable from computers\\nwith regard to the task of searching. In the case of humans interacting with an agent\\nwhile working, even if the agent stops to function, I believe that a human would\\nbe able to continue working with their own efforts. This is because even if humans\\nrely on machines to shoulder part of their thinking, it is not to say that humans are\\nincapable of thinking on their own without the machine. In the case of working with\\na machine, we can say that we are relying on the machine, but we do not unilaterally\\ndepend on them.\\nIf a human connects his/her computer directly to the human brain, it will be\\nquite difﬁcult to separate the human and the computer. I think that the collaboration\\nbetween humans and agents should be very similar to the collaboration between\\npeople, including the way of communicating that information. Or, sometimes, I think'),\n",

At\\nthat time, I think that the person who ﬁnished learning as much as possible should\\nbe able to do the job without agent assistance or guidance.\\nIn terms of educational psychology, there is scaffolding. This is a tool (or some-\\none’s support) to raise the learner to a level that can accomplish the task that could\\nnot be achieved by one person alone. And when it comes to being able to do a speciﬁc\\njob, it also means to do education aiming to be able to be executed even without that\\nsupport.\\nI expect that humans can be separated from agents by supporting agents based on\\nthe concept of scaffolding. However, agents cannot always be a teacher for humans.\\nIn the case that the agent can do better with respect to a speciﬁc job than a human,\\nit will be able to support such that it can be understood naturally well. Then, I think\\nwhether it will be possible for that person to do as it is, even if any human is not as\\ngood as an agent.\\nWell, in the abovementioned paper, the following things are also mentioned.\\n“However, many problems that can be thought through in advance are very difﬁcult\\nto think through in advance. They would be easier to solve, and they could be solved\\nfaster, through an intuitively guided trial-and-error procedure in which the computer\\ncooperated, turning up ﬂaws in the reasoning or revealing unexpected turns in the\\nsolution. Other problems simply cannot be formulated without computing-machine\\naid. Poincare anticipated the frustration of an important group of would-be computer\\nusers when he said, “The question is not, ‘What is the answer?’ The question is, ‘What\\nis the question?’” One of the main aims of man-computer symbiosis is to bring the\\ncomputing machine effectively into the formulative parts of technical problems.”\\nIn other words, in order to solve the problem that we face frequently in reality,\\nthe problem is solved earlier by human and computer collaborating with trial and\\nerror. Here, trial and error by humans and computers means that the computer repeats\\nthe process of verifying the hypotheses considered by humans. This is also “work\\nfor computers to solve problems” and “work for humans to understand problems.”\\nThis situation can be said to be one example where a symbiotic relationship between\\nhumans and computers is established.\\nThe symbiotic relationship between humans and artiﬁcial intelligence (agents)\\nis similar to this idea. Humans and artiﬁcial intelligence should coexist with each\\nother so that they can be separated as much as possible and that humans unilaterally\\ndepend on artiﬁcial intelligence.\\n6.5 Agents Embedded in Ordinary Things\\nI would like to show examples where a human and an agent coexist in everyday life.\\nWe developed the system called Ubiquitous Talker in 1995 (Nagao and Rekimoto\\n1995). This is made with the concept of making everyday things as agents and\\nallowing them to interact with humans. Although the term “ubiquitous” has become\\nless used recently, it is based on the idea of Ubiquitous Computing (Mark Weiser'),\n",
              " Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Artificial Intelligence Accelerates Human Learning_ Discussion Data Analytics ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'page': 152}, page_content='146 6 Symbiosis between Humans and Artiﬁcial Intelligence\\nFig. 6.3 Ubiquitous talker in use\\nproposed in 1988), the idea that computers are ubiquitously coordinated to expand\\nthe human environment (Weiser 1991). Figure 6.3 shows how this system is used.\\nIn this ﬁgure, when a person holds the portable device (currently smartphone) that\\nhe has in hand, he can communicate with that one by voice. At the time of making\\nthis, there was no concept of the cloud, so the agent’s intelligence was implemented\\non the side of the machine used by the user. Currently, in order to incorporate the\\nmechanism of machine learning (especially deep learning), things will talk to humans\\nwhile communicating with the cloud.\\nRecently, the term Internet of Things (IoT) came to be used. This is an idea of\\nimplementing the function of connecting with the Internet to all things operating on\\nelectricity and linking it with the cloud. One characteristic is that items themselves\\nmay not have a mechanism for exchanging information with users. In that case, the\\nuser can receive services from IoT by accessing the cloud with a smartphone or PC. I\\nthink that the important function that IoT should have is to discover useful information\\nfor humans by collecting and analyzing data on the environment surrounding humans\\nrather than directly interacting with humans. Probably, IoT devices will need to work\\nwith the cloud for this learning.\\nOne example of IoT is a smart light bulb. This has a function that connects each\\nLED light bulb installed on the ceiling or other locations to the Internet (or an intranet\\nlimited to the building). And the users can freely change brightness and color using'),\n",

It is a function that is not yet available in the current smart\\nlight bulb, but considering which one is near the light bulb, what the person is\\ndoing right now, and what kind of environment is desirable, and cooperating with\\nother surrounding lighting and clouds, light bulbs will actively create a lighting\\nenvironment suitable for the surrounding people.\\nThe previously smart speaker is also a kind of IoT. If IoT can communicate with\\nhumans by voice, it will be possible to realize the Ubiquitous Talker previously\\nproposed by the authors as more practical. It will further step forward the symbiosis\\nof humans and artiﬁcial intelligence. For example, if you do not know how to use\\nthe tools when you want to do the work, ask the tool or the machine how to use that\\ntool. At that time, if your skill level is converted to data, you can make the tool refer\\nto that data. Then the intelligent agent embedded in that tool will guide you how to\\nuse it in an easy-to-understand way. If the guide does not go well, you can tell the\\nagent “I want to know more about it.” It is very useful information for agents. It will\\nprobably be converted to a teacher signal to update the machine learning model of\\nthe agent.\\nAnd we can realize the symbiosis of human and artiﬁcial intelligence with respect\\nto intellectual activities which are very important to humans such as discussions\\nand presentations which we have repeatedly described in this book. In that case,\\nan agent will appear in the place of discussion and presentation. The agent will\\nevaluate humans’ discussions and presentations, and will feed the results back. The\\nagent also contributes to creation of minutes. Also, in some cases, it may make\\nstatements that stimulate human creativity. At that time, it can be said that the agent\\nis also participating in intelligent creative activities with humans. Agents will also\\nparticipate in the gamiﬁed discussion mentioned in Chap. 4. In that case, the agent\\nmay be able to make better statements after being evaluated by other participants and\\nmay eventually become an excellent trainer for discussion beginners one day.\\nI cannot predict how symbiotic relationships between humans and artiﬁcial intel-\\nligence will transform with the arrival of technological singularity or the emergence\\nof much higher artiﬁcial intelligence than at present. I do not know whether their\\nsymbiotic relationships are becoming more sophisticated symbiotic relationships\\nwith higher capabilities from each other or whether they are becoming unilateral\\nsubordination so that humans are inferior to artiﬁcial intelligence. Believing that the\\nformer will be realized, I will continue my research in the future.\\n6.6 Artiﬁcial Intelligence Accelerates Human Learning\\nFinally, I will describe the topic “artiﬁcial intelligence accelerates human learning”\\nwhich is also the title of this book. Speciﬁcally, it is about research on an AI trainer\\nwhich improves student’s discussion and presentation skills.\\nIn the story of the previous chapters, AI was not playing the role of guiding humans\\nbut was to support humans from behind. This is because it was difﬁcult for humans'),\n",

However, the future AI is not out of sight\\nas a support system. On the contrary, it seems to actively participate with humans as\\nan agent.\\nThe purpose of our research is to intentionally introduce automation with respect\\nto tasks that are concerned about automation and aims to demonstrate with scien-\\ntiﬁc basis that performance will be higher than humans perform. One such task is\\neducation, especially dealing with education on discussion and presentation.\\nSpeciﬁcally, we are developing a robot trainer (shown in Fig. 6.4) that utilizes\\nvarious sensors, link with information tools used by students, and bringing about\\na mechanism to make appropriate suggestions especially for discussion between\\nstudents and presentations by students. In this task, detailed data analysis will clarify\\nthat the skill of students improves when AI analyzes, evaluates, and comments on\\ndata rather than teaching by a human trainer.\\nDuring the discussion, the robot trainer is always at the side of the student, observ-\\ning the situation, taking some appropriate timing, and doing some suggestions. For\\nexample, as far as the number of utterances is fewer than other participants, it is\\nbetter to speak more, as to the question better not to return it as a question, better to\\nsay the conclusion earlier, and so on.\\nLikewise, when a student makes a presentation, the robot trainer is always listening\\nnearby, and a comment is made after the presentation. For example, the voice was'),\n",

This is similar to the audience AI of the VR presentation training\\nsystem mentioned at the end of Chap. 5. However, while the audience AI only\\nresponds to the human presentation, the robot trainer actively tells humans to promote\\nlearning.\\nAutomation in the ﬁeld of education is not necessarily progressing properly. This\\nis not only technically difﬁcult but also because education is done for humans,\\nand that automation seems to be due to a simple intuition that it does not pro-\\nduce very good effects. The e-learning system and Learning Analytics mentioned in\\nChap. 1 have increased the number of elements that can be converted to data (Daniel\\n2017). However, it has not been realized at a manageable level a mechanism that\\nautomatically analyzes the data and appropriately reﬂects it in the guidance.\\nTherefore, we examine the hypothesis that “the presentation of concrete data on\\nthe student’s condition and guidance based on it are more likely to be accepted by\\nstudents than instructed by humans” and realize automation in education. As a result,\\nhuman learning is accelerated by AI.\\nThe speciﬁc veriﬁcation method will be described below.\\nExpanding the results so far on the analysis and evaluation of discussion and pre-\\nsentation, we realize a mechanism to improve students’ discussion and presentation\\nskills using humanoid robots, and conduct demonstration experiments for laboratory\\nstudents. For that purpose, we record discussions and presentations, analyze contex-\\ntual information such as the internal structure of the materials (slides and posters,\\netc.), visual and auditory scenes of students’ activities, participants’ mental states,\\nand then evaluate the quality of their activities.\\nBased on the analysis results of the data, we propose a way to give effective\\nsuggestions to humans. In conjunction with the discussion and presentation support\\nsystems mentioned in Chap. 5, we develop a robot trainer that evaluates student\\nactivities and gives them a suggestion at an appropriate timing. Then, we compare\\nguidance results with human experts and verify the effectiveness of the robot trainer.\\nIn the case of discussion, we will expand the discussion mining system and inte-\\ngrate mechanisms that recognize gestures and expressions of participants in real\\ntime. In the case of a slide presentation, software for analyzing the internal structure\\nof the slide and analyzing the browsing behavior of the participant who views the\\nslide is developed. On the other hand, in the case of poster presentations, we plan to\\ndevelop software to analyze the digital poster creation and operation log, as well as\\nsoftware that will record the presentation and analyze the images and sound captured\\nduring recording. Recognition of the position and posture of the surrounding people\\nis also performed by means of depth sensors mounted on the ceiling that are capa-\\nble of tracking the human body. In addition, wearable devices (e.g., Apple Watch)\\nto measure heart rate are attached to all students, and psychophysiological data are\\nalso collected in real time and subject to analysis. These systems are the foundation\\nsystem for operating the robot trainer.'),\n",

In addition to human facial expression,\\ngaze, and voice, biometric information based on heart rate acquired from wearable\\ndevices can also be used, and in collaboration with a discussion/presentation support\\ntool, students’ skills can be analyzed and evaluated. Activity records and comments\\ncan be reviewed later through the foundation system.\\nIn order to make the evaluation of the robot trainer universal, it is necessary\\nto analyze the record of the discussion and presentation from various viewpoints\\nand establish the evaluation method. This is done by organizing the mechanisms\\ndescribed in Chaps. 4 and 5 and clarifying the evaluation index and its calculation\\nmethod. For example, in the case of discussion, the following points are considered.\\nThe quality and frequency of statements, the attitude toward others’ opinions (agree,\\ndisagree, disinterest), the size of voice of statements, whether the direction of gaze\\ntoward the discussion partner, whether the discussion is diverging or converging,\\nwhether it is not diverting the topic, whether it properly responds to questions from\\nothers, and the like become the point of view.\\nAlso, in the case of a presentation, it is necessary to decide whether the content\\nsuch as a slide or a poster is easy for the viewer to understand, whether the theme or\\nresult has an impact and gets interest, whether the contents are structured in a well-\\nbalanced manner, whether the layout is appropriate, whether the way of presentation\\n(how to watch gaze, voice size, speaking speed, time balance, etc.) is appropriate,\\nwhether relaxing during presentation, whether the responder answers the question\\nproperly, and so on.\\nThis is based on the guidelines of the American Evaluation Association ( http://\\nwww.eval.org/). In order to conﬁrm the validity of the automatic evaluation method,\\nstudents are asked to self-evaluate their own activity records by selecting representa-\\ntive ones. Also, we ask students to evaluate each other’s activities mutually. We are\\nplanning to compare and analyze these results and the evaluation by the system.\\nNext, it is necessary to link the evaluation of the discussion/presentation to con-\\ncrete guidance. Basically, it is the way that the robot trainer is at the side of the\\nstudent, giving advice so that the evaluation goes up at an appropriate time, or advis-\\ning not to lower the evaluation. One of the hypotheses of this research is that advice\\nby the machine is more likely to be accepted than advice by humans in the case of\\nadvice based on the concrete evaluation index and speciﬁc data clarifying the score.\\nIf similar failures are repeatedly pointed out, perhaps you would feel uncomfortable\\nif this fact were pointed out by another human. However, in the case of machines, it\\nis not so annoying and we can calmly consider their advice.\\nWhether a student feels uncomfortable is judged based on psychophysiological\\ninformation such as a heart rate. In addition, students should be able to view the\\nevaluation of their past activities at any time, so that they can compare their activities\\nwith others’ activities. Furthermore, we compare the content and evaluation of our\\nactivities in chronological order, visualize the degree of growth, and make it possible\\nto discover problems by themselves compared to the growth of others. When that\\nproblem occurs again, the robot trainer advises by referring to past guidance so'),\n",

If they are aware of the problem, it will be easier to\\naccept instructions from the robot. Applying this mechanism to laboratory students,\\nwe conﬁrm that their discussions and presentations are highly evaluated since their\\nskills are improved.\\nBy summarizing the results so far, it is possible to realize a method of automatically\\nevaluating discussion and presentation quality and an effective teaching method for\\nmachines. When the student performs a discussion/presentation, the robot trainer\\nevaluates the activities from various viewpoints and makes leading comments. For\\nexample, it points out the low number of statements, suggests the timing to speak,\\nand points out the quietness of their voice and encourages the presenter to speak\\nup. Also, it points out if the content of the slide is inappropriate and asks for the\\npresentation of a slide with a more detailed explanation, and so on.\\nIn addition, visualization and presentation of evaluation details and time series\\ndata compared with past activities are presented. Next, we compare the degree of the\\nchange in the evaluation in the case of direct guidance by human with the case of the\\nrobot trainer. In the case of a human trainer, we distinguish between instructing based\\non the data analyzed by the system and instructing based on the subjective evaluation\\nof the human trainer. And it shows that the degree of improvement of the evaluation\\nis signiﬁcantly higher in the case of using the robot trainer compared with either case\\nof the human trainer. By doing this, it is possible to empirically demonstrate the case\\nof AI accelerating human learning.\\nThe plan is a 3-year schedule and, as of writing of this book, it is still the ﬁrst\\nyear, so we cannot state the results of this research here unfortunately.

In recent years, \\nmachines have surpassed humans in the performance of certain specific tasks, such as some aspects of \\nimage recognition. Experts forecast that rapid progress in the field of specialized artificial intelligence \\nwill continue. Although it is very unlikely that machines will exhibit broadly-applicable intelligence \\ncomparable to or exceeding that of humans in the next 20 years, it is to be expected that machines will \\nreach and exceed human performance on more and more tasks. \\nAs a contribution toward preparing the United States for a future in which AI plays a growing role, this \\nreport surveys the current state of AI, its existing and potential applications, and the questions that are \\nraised for society and public policy by progress in AI. The report also makes recommendations for \\nspecific further actions by Federal agencies and other actors. A companion document lays out a strategic \\nplan for Federally-funded research and development in AI. Additionally, in the coming months, the \\nAdministration will release a follow-on report exploring in greater depth the effect of AI-driven \\nautomation on jobs and the economy. \\nThe report was developed by the NSTC’s Subcommittee on Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, \\nwhich was chartered in May 2016 to foster interagency coordination, to provide technical and policy \\nadvice on topics related to AI, and to monitor the development of AI technologies across industry, the \\nresearch community, and the Federal Government. The report was reviewed by the NSTC Committee on \\nTechnology, which concurred with its contents. The report follows a series of public-outreach activities \\nspearheaded by the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) in 2016, which \\nincluded five public workshops co-hosted with universities and other associations that are referenced in \\nthis report. \\nOSTP also published a Request for Information (RFI) in June 2016, which received 161 responses. The \\nsubmitted comments were published by OSTP on September 6, 2016. Consistent with the role of Big \\nData as an enabler of AI, this report builds on three previous Administration reports on Big Data \\nreferenced in this report. \\nIn the coming years, AI will continue to contribute to economic growth and will be a valuable tool for \\nimproving the world, as long as industry, civil society, and government work together to develop the \\npositive aspects of the technology, manage its risks and challenges, and ensure that everyone has the \\nopportunity to help in building an AI-enhanced society and to participate in its benefits. \\n \\nSincerely, \\n \\n \\nJohn P.

We also make recommendations \\nfor specific further actions by Federal agencies and other actors. A companion document called the \\nNational Artificial Intelligence Research and Development Strategic Plan lays out a strategic plan for \\nFederally-funded research and development in AI. \\nApplications of AI for Public Good \\nOne area of great optimism about AI and machine learning is their potential to improve people’s lives by \\nhelping to solve some of the world’s greatest challenges and inefficiencies. Many have compared the \\npromise of AI to the transformative impacts of advancements in mobile computing. Public- and private-\\nsector investments in basic and applied R&D on AI have already begun reaping major benefits to the \\npublic in fields as diverse as health care, transportation, the environment, criminal justice, and economic \\ninclusion. The effectiveness of government itself is being increased as agencies build their capacity to use \\nAI to carry out their missions more quickly, responsively, and efficiently. \\nAI and Regulation  \\nAI has applications in many products, such as cars and aircraft, which are subject to regulation designed \\nto protect the public from harm and ensure fairness in economic competition. How will the incorporation \\nof AI into these products affect the relevant regulatory approaches?  In general, the approach to regulation \\nof AI-enabled products to protect public safety should be informed by assessment of the aspects of risk \\nthat the addition of AI may reduce alongside the aspects of risk that it may increase. If a risk falls within \\nthe bounds of an existing regulatory regime, moreover, the policy discussion should start by considering \\nwhether the existing regulations already adequately address the risk, or whether they need to be adapted \\nto the addition of AI. Also, where regulatory responses to the addition of AI threaten to increase the cost \\nof compliance, or slow the development or adoption of beneficial innovations, policymakers should \\nconsider how those responses could be adjusted to lower costs and barriers to innovation without \\nadversely impacting safety or market fairness. \\nCurrently relevant examples of the regulatory challenges that AI-enabled products present are found in \\nthe cases of automated vehicles (AVs, such as self-driving cars) and AI-equipped unmanned aircraft \\nsystems (UAS, or “drones”). In the long run, AVs will likely save many lives by reducing driver error and \\nincreasing personal mobility, and UAS will offer many economic benefits. Yet public safety must be \\nprotected as these technologies are tested and begin to mature. The Department of Transportation (DOT) \\nis using an approach to evolving the relevant regulations that is based on building expertise in the \\nDepartment, creating safe spaces and test beds for experimentation, and working with industry and civil \\nsociety to evolve performance-based regulations that will enable more uses as evidence of safe operation \\naccumulates. \\nResearch and Workforce \\nGovernment also has an important role to play in the advancement of AI through research and \\ndevelopment and the growth of a skilled, diverse workforce. A separate strategic plan for Federally-\\nfunded AI research and development is being released in conjunction with this report. The plan discusses \\nthe role of Federal R&D, identifies areas of opportunity, and recommends ways to coordinate R&D to \\nmaximize benefit and build a highly-trained workforce. '),\n",

An AI-enabled world demands a data-literate citizenry that is able to read, use, \\ninterpret, and communicate about data, and participate in policy debates about matters affected by AI. AI \\nknowledge and education are increasingly emphasized in Federal Science, Technology, Engineering, and \\nMathematics (STEM) education programs. AI education is also a component of Computer Science for \\nAll, the President’s initiative to empower all American students from kindergarten through high school to \\nlearn computer science and be equipped with the computational thinking skills they need in a technology-\\ndriven world. \\nEconomic Impacts of AI \\nAI’s central economic effect in the short term will be the automation of tasks that could not be automated \\nbefore. This will likely increase productivity and create wealth, but it may also affect particular types of \\njobs in different ways, reducing demand for certain skills that can be automated while increasing demand \\nfor other skills that are complementary to AI. Analysis by the White House Council of Economic \\nAdvisors (CEA) suggests that the negative effect of automation will be greatest on lower-wage jobs, and \\nthat there is a risk that AI-driven automation will increase the wage gap between less-educated and more-\\neducated workers, potentially increasing economic inequality. Public policy can address these risks, \\nensuring that workers are retrained and able to succeed in occupations that are complementary to, rather \\nthan competing with, automation. Public policy can also ensure that the economic benefits created by AI \\nare shared broadly, and assure that AI responsibly ushers in a new age in the global economy. \\nFairness, Safety, and Governance \\nAs AI technologies move toward broader deployment, technical experts, policy analysts, and ethicists \\nhave raised concerns about unintended consequences of widespread adoption. Use of AI to make \\nconsequential decisions about people, often replacing decisions made by human-driven bureaucratic \\nprocesses, leads to concerns about how to ensure justice, fairness, and accountability—the same concerns \\nvoiced previously in the Administration’s Big Data: Seizing Opportunities, Preserving Values report of \\n2014,1 as well as the Report to the President on Big Data and Privacy: A Technological Perspective \\npublished by the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology in 2014.2 Transparency \\nconcerns focus not only on the data and algorithms involved, but also on the potential to have some form \\nof explanation for any AI-based determination. Yet AI experts have cautioned that there are inherent \\nchallenges in trying to understand and predict the behavior of advanced AI systems. \\nUse of AI to control physical-world equipment leads to concerns about safety, especially as systems are \\nexposed to the full complexity of the human environment. A major challenge in AI safety is building \\nsystems that can safely transition from the “closed world” of the laboratory into the outside “open world” \\nwhere unpredictable things can happen. Adapting gracefully to unforeseen situations is difficult yet \\nnecessary for safe operation. Experience in building other types of safety-critical systems and \\ninfrastructure, such as aircraft, power plants, bridges, and vehicles, has much to teach AI practitioners \\n                                                           \\n1 “Big Data: Seizing Opportunities, Preserving Values,” Executive Office of the President, May 2014, \\nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/big_data_privacy_report_may_1_2014.pdf.  \\n2 The President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, “Report to the President: Big Data and Privacy: \\nA Technological Perspective,” Executive Office of the President, May 2014, \\nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/PCAST/pcast_big_data_and_privacy_ -\\n_may_2014.pdf.

In both cases, practitioners strive to \\navoid unintended behavior, and to generate the evidence needed to give stakeholders justified confidence \\nthat unintended failures are unlikely. \\nEthical training for AI practitioners and students is a necessary part of the solution. Ideally, every student \\nlearning AI, computer science, or data science would be exposed to curriculum and discussion on related \\nethics and security topics. However, ethics alone is not sufficient. Ethics can help practitioners understand \\ntheir responsibilities to all stakeholders, but ethical training should be augmented with technical tools and \\nmethods for putting good intentions into practice by doing the technical work needed to prevent \\nunacceptable outcomes. \\nGlobal Considerations and Security \\nAI poses policy questions across a range of areas in international relations and security. AI has been a \\ntopic of interest in recent international discussions as countries, multilateral institutions, and other \\nstakeholders have begun to access the benefits and challenges of AI. Dialogue and cooperation between \\nthese entities could help advance AI R&D and harness AI for good, while also addressing shared \\nchallenges. \\nToday’s AI has important applications in cybersecurity, and is expected to play an increasing role for both \\ndefensive and offensive cyber measures. Currently, designing and operating secure systems requires \\nsignificant time and attention from experts. Automating this expert work partially or entirely may increase \\nsecurity across a much broader range of systems and applications at dramatically lower cost, and could \\nincrease the agility of the Nation’s cyber-defenses. Using AI may help maintain the rapid response \\nrequired to detect and react to the landscape of evolving threats. \\nChallenging issues are raised by the potential use of AI in weapon systems. The United States has \\nincorporated autonomy in certain weapon systems for decades, allowing for greater precision in the use of \\nweapons and safer, more humane military operations. Nonetheless, moving away from direct human \\ncontrol of weapon systems involves some risks and can raise legal and ethical questions.  \\nThe key to incorporating autonomous and semi-autonomous weapon systems into American defense \\nplanning is to ensure that U.S. Government entities are always acting in accordance with international \\nhumanitarian law, taking appropriate steps to control proliferation, and working with partners and Allies \\nto develop standards related to the development and use of such weapon systems. The United States has \\nactively participated in ongoing international discussion on Lethal Autonomous Weapon Systems, and \\nanticipates continued robust international discussion of these potential weapon systems. Agencies across \\nthe U.S. Government are working to develop a single, government-wide policy, consistent with \\ninternational humanitarian law, on autonomous and semi-autonomous weapons. \\nPreparing for the Future \\nAI holds the potential to be a major driver of economic growth and social progress, if industry, civil \\nsociety, government, and the public work together to support development of the technology with \\nthoughtful attention to its potential and to managing its risks. \\nThe U.S. Government has several roles to play. It can convene conversations about important issues and \\nhelp to set the agenda for public debate. It can monitor the safety and fairness of applications as they \\ndevelop, and adapt regulatory frameworks to encourage innovation while protecting the public. It can \\nprovide public policy tools to ensure that disruption in the means and methods of work enabled by AI \\nincreases productivity while avoiding negative economic consequences for certain sectors of the \\nworkforce. It can support basic research and the application of AI to public good. It can support \\ndevelopment of a skilled, diverse workforce. And government can use AI itself to serve the public faster, '),\n",

Many areas of public policy, from education and the economic safety \\nnet, to defense, environmental preservation, and criminal justice, will see new opportunities and new \\nchallenges driven by the continued progress of AI. The U.S. Government must continue to build its \\ncapacity to understand and adapt to these changes. \\nAs the technology of AI continues to develop, practitioners must ensure that AI-enabled systems are \\ngovernable; that they are open, transparent, and understandable; that they can work effectively with \\npeople; and that their operation will remain consistent with human values and aspirations.

Smart vehicles may save hundreds of thousands of lives every year worldwide, and increase \\nmobility for the elderly and those with disabilities. Smart buildings may save energy and reduce carbon \\nemissions. Precision medicine may extend life and increase quality of life. Smarter government may serve \\ncitizens more quickly and precisely, better protect those at risk, and save money. AI-enhanced education \\nmay help teachers give every child an education that opens doors to a secure and fulfilling life. These are \\njust a few of the potential benefits if the technology is developed with an eye to its benefits and with \\ncareful consideration of its risks and challenges. \\nThe United States has been at the forefront of foundational research in AI, primarily supported for most of \\nthe field’s history by Federal research funding and work at government laboratories.  The Federal \\nGovernment’s support for unclassified AI R&D is managed through the Networking and Information \\nTechnology Research and Development (NITRD) program, and supported primarily by the Defense \\nAdvanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the National Science Foundation (NSF), the National \\nInstitutes of Health (NIH), the Office of Naval Research (ONR), and the Intelligence Advanced Research \\nProjects Activity (IARPA). Major national research efforts such as the National Strategic Computing \\nInitiative, the Big Data Initiative, and the Brain Research through Advancing Innovative \\nNeurotechnologies (BRAIN) Initiative also contribute indirectly to the progress of AI research. The \\ncurrent and projected benefits of AI technology are large, adding to the Nation’s economic vitality and to \\nthe productivity and well-being of its people. A companion document lays out a strategic plan for \\nFederally-funded research and development in AI. \\nAs a contribution toward preparing the United States for a future in which AI plays a growing role, we \\nsurvey the current state of AI, its existing and potential applications, and the questions that progress in AI \\nraise for society and public policy. We also make recommendations for specific further actions by Federal \\nagencies and other actors.  \\nA Brief History of AI \\nEndowing computers with human-like intelligence has been a dream of computer experts since the dawn \\nof electronic computing. Although the term “Artificial Intelligence” was not coined until 1956, the roots \\nof the field go back to at least the 1940s,3 and the idea of AI was crystalized in Alan Turing’s famous \\n1950 paper, “Computing Machinery and Intelligence.” Turing’s paper posed the question: “Can machines \\nthink?” It also proposed a test for answering that question,4 and raised the possibility that a machine might \\nbe programmed to learn from experience much as a young child does. \\nIn the ensuing decades, the field of AI went through ups and downs as some AI research problems proved \\nmore difficult than anticipated and others proved insurmountable with the technologies of the time. It \\nwasn’t until the late 1990s that research progress in AI began to accelerate, as researchers focused more \\non sub-problems of AI and the application of AI to real-world problems such as image recognition and \\nmedical diagnosis. An early milestone was the 1997 victory of IBM’s chess-playing computer Deep Blue \\n                                                           \\n3 See, e.g., Warren S. McCulloch and Walter H. Pitts, “A Logical Calculus of the Ideas Immanent in Nervous \\nActivity,” Bulletin of Mathematical Biophysics, 5:115-133, 1943. \\n4 Restated in modern terms, the “Turing Test” puts a human judge in a text-based chat room with either another \\nperson or a computer. The human judge can interrogate the other party and carry on a conversation, and then the \\njudge is asked to guess whether the other party is a person or a computer. If a computer can consistently fool human \\njudges in this game, then the computer is deemed to be exhibiting intelligence.  '),\n",

Other significant breakthroughs included DARPA’s Cognitive \\nAgent that Learns and Organizes (CALO), which led to Apple Inc.’s Siri; IBM’s question-answering \\ncomputer Watson’s victory in the TV game show “Jeopardy!”; and the surprising success of self-driving \\ncars in the DARPA Grand Challenge competitions in the 2000s.  \\nThe current wave of progress and enthusiasm for AI began around 2010, driven by three factors that built \\nupon each other: the availability of big data from sources including e-commerce, businesses, social \\nmedia, science, and government; which provided raw material for dramatically improved machine \\nlearning approaches and algorithms; which in turn relied on the capabilities of more powerful \\ncomputers.5 During this period, the pace of improvement surprised AI experts. For example, on a popular \\nimage recognition challenge6 that has a 5 percent human error rate according to one error measure, the \\nbest AI result improved from a 26 percent error rate in 2011 to 3.5 percent in 2015.  \\nSimultaneously, industry has been increasing its investment in AI. In 2016, Google Chief Executive \\nOfficer (CEO) Sundar Pichai said, “Machine learning [a subfield of AI] is a core, transformative way by \\nwhich we’re rethinking how we’re doing everything. We are thoughtfully applying it across all our \\nproducts, be it search, ads, YouTube, or Play. And we’re in early days, but you will see us\\u200a—\\u200ain a \\nsystematic way\\u200a—\\u200aapply machine learning in all these areas.”7 This view of AI broadly impacting how \\nsoftware is created and delivered was widely shared by CEOs in the technology industry, including Ginni \\nRometty of IBM, who has said that her organization is betting the company on AI.8 \\nWhat is Artificial Intelligence? \\nThere is no single definition of AI that is universally accepted by practitioners. Some define AI loosely as \\na computerized system that exhibits behavior that is commonly thought of as requiring intelligence. \\nOthers define AI as a system capable of rationally solving complex problems or taking appropriate \\nactions to achieve its goals in whatever real world circumstances it encounters. \\nExperts offer differing taxonomies of AI problems and solutions. A popular AI textbook9 used the \\nfollowing taxonomy: (1) systems that think like humans (e.g., cognitive architectures and neural \\nnetworks); (2) systems that act like humans (e.g., pass the Turing test via natural language processing; \\nknowledge representation, automated reasoning, and learning), (3) systems that think rationally (e.g., \\n                                                           \\n5 A more detailed history of AI is available in the Appendix of the AI 100 Report.

Separately, venture capitalist Frank Chen broke down the \\nproblem space of AI into five general categories: logical reasoning, knowledge representation, planning \\nand navigation, natural language processing, and perception.10 And AI researcher Pedro Domingos \\nascribed AI researchers to five “tribes” based on the methods they use: “symbolists” use logical reasoning \\nbased on abstract symbols, “connectionists” build structures inspired by the human brain; \\n“evolutionaries” use methods inspired by Darwinian evolution; “Bayesians” use probabilistic inference; \\nand “analogizers” extrapolate from similar cases seen previously.11 \\nThis diversity of AI problems and solutions, and the foundation of AI in human evaluation of the \\nperformance and accuracy of algorithms, makes it difficult to clearly define a bright-line distinction \\nbetween what constitutes AI and what does not. For example, many techniques used to analyze large \\nvolumes of data were developed by AI researchers and are now identified as “Big Data” algorithms and \\nsystems. In some cases, opinion may shift, meaning that a problem is considered as requiring AI before it \\nhas been solved, but once a solution is well known it is considered routine data processing. Although the \\nboundaries of AI can be uncertain and have tended to shift over time, what is important is that a core \\nobjective of AI research and applications over the years has been to automate or replicate intelligent \\nbehavior.  \\nThe Current State of AI \\nRemarkable progress has been made on what is known as Narrow AI, which addresses specific \\napplication areas such as playing strategic games, language translation, self-driving vehicles, and image \\nrecognition.12 Narrow AI underpins many commercial services such as trip planning, shopper \\nrecommendation systems, and ad targeting, and is finding important applications in medical diagnosis, \\neducation, and scientific research. These have all had significant societal benefits and have contributed to \\nthe economic vitality of the Nation.13 \\nGeneral AI (sometimes called Artificial General Intelligence, or AGI) refers to a notional future AI \\nsystem that exhibits apparently intelligent behavior at least as advanced as a person across the full range \\nof cognitive tasks. A broad chasm seems to separate today’s Narrow AI from the much more difficult \\nchallenge of General AI. Attempts to reach General AI by expanding Narrow AI solutions have made \\nlittle headway over many decades of research. The current consensus of the private-sector expert \\ncommunity, with which the NSTC Committee on Technology concurs, is that General AI will not be \\nachieved for at least decades.14 \\n                                                           \\n10 Frank Chen, “AI, Deep Learning, and Machine Learning: A Primer,” Andreessen Horowitz, June 10, 2016, \\nhttp://a16z.com/2016/06/10/ai-deep-learning-machines. \\n11 Pedro Domingos, The Master Algorithm: How the Quest for the Ultimate Learning Machine Will Remake Our \\nWorld (New York, New York: Basic Books, 2015). \\n12 Narrow AI is not a single technical approach, but rather a set of discrete problems whose solutions rely on a \\ntoolkit of AI methods along with some problem-specific algorithms.

If computers could exert control over many critical systems, the result \\ncould be havoc, with humans no longer in control of their destiny at best and extinct at worst. This \\nscenario has long been the subject of science fiction stories, and recent pronouncements from some \\ninfluential industry leaders have highlighted these fears. \\nA more positive view of the future held by many researchers sees instead the development of intelligent \\nsystems that work well as helpers, assistants, trainers, and teammates of humans, and are designed to \\noperate safely and ethically. \\nThe NSTC Committee on Technology’s assessment is that long-term concerns about super-intelligent \\nGeneral AI should have little impact on current policy. The policies the Federal Government should adopt \\nin the near-to-medium term if these fears are justified are almost exactly the same policies the Federal \\nGovernment should adopt if they are not justified. The best way to build capacity for addressing the \\nlonger-term speculative risks is to attack the less extreme risks already seen today, such as current \\nsecurity, privacy, and safety risks, while investing in research on longer-term capabilities and how their \\nchallenges might be managed. Additionally, as research and applications in the field continue to mature, \\npractitioners of AI in government and business should approach advances with appropriate consideration \\nof the long-term societal and ethical questions – in additional to just the technical questions – that such \\nadvances portend. Although prudence dictates some attention to the possibility that harmful super-\\nintelligence might someday become possible, these concerns should not be the main driver of public \\npolicy for AI. \\nMachine Learning \\nMachine learning is one of the most important technical approaches to AI and the basis of many recent \\nadvances and commercial applications of AI. Modern machine learning is a statistical process that starts \\nwith a body of data and tries to derive a rule or procedure that explains the data or can predict future data. \\nThis approach—learning from data—contrasts with the older “expert system” approach to AI, in which \\nprogrammers sit down with human domain experts to learn the rules and criteria used to make decisions, \\nand translate those rules into software code. An expert system aims to emulate the principles used by \\nhuman experts, whereas machine learning relies on statistical methods to find a decision procedure that \\nworks well in practice. \\nAn advantage of machine learning is that it can be used even in cases where it is infeasible or difficult to \\nwrite down explicit rules to solve a problem. For example, a company that runs an online service might \\nuse machine learning to detect user log-in attempts that are fraudulent. The company might start with a \\nlarge data set of past login attempts, with each attempt labeled as fraudulent or not using the benefit of \\n                                                           \\nwould outplay humans at chess within a decade, an outcome that required 40 years to occur. Early predictions about \\nautomated language translation also proved wildly optimistic, with the technology only becoming usable (and by no \\nmeans fully fluent) in the last several years. It is tempting but incorrect to extrapolate from the ability to solve one \\nparticular task to imagine machines with a much broader and deeper range of capabilities and to overlook the huge \\ngap between narrow task-oriented performance and the type of general intelligence that people exhibit.  \\n15 It is far from certain that this sort of explosive growth in intelligence is likely, or even possible. Another pl ausible \\nextrapolation from current knowledge is that machine intelligence will continue to increase gradually even after \\nsurpassing human intelligence. '),\n",

Based on this data set, the company could use machine learning to derive a rule to apply to \\nfuture login attempts that predicts which attempts are more likely to be fraudulent and should be subjected \\nto extra security measures. In a sense, machine learning is not an algorithm for solving a specific problem, \\nbut rather a more general approach to finding solutions for many different problems, given data about \\nthem. \\nTo apply machine learning, a practitioner starts with a historical data set, which the practitioner divides \\ninto a training set and a test set. The practitioner chooses a model, or mathematical structure that \\ncharacterizes a range of possible decision-making rules with adjustable parameters. A common analogy is \\nthat the model is a “box” that applies a rule, and the parameters are adjustable knobs on the front of the \\nbox that control how the box operates. In practice, a model might have many millions of parameters. \\nThe practitioner also defines an objective function used to evaluate the desirability of the outcome that \\nresults from a particular choice of parameters. The objective function will typically contain parts that \\nreward the model for closely matching the training set, as well as parts that reward the use of simpler \\nrules.  \\nTraining the model is the process of adjusting the parameters to maximize the objective function. \\nTraining is the difficult technical step in machine learning. A model with millions of parameters will have \\nastronomically more possible outcomes than any algorithm could ever hope to try, so successful training \\nalgorithms have to be clever in how they explore the space of parameter settings so as to find very good \\nsettings with a feasible level of computational effort.  \\nOnce a model has been trained, the practitioner can use the test set to evaluate the accuracy and \\neffectiveness of the model. The goal of machine learning is to create a trained model that will \\ngeneralize—it will be accurate not only on examples in the training set, but also on future cases that it has \\nnever seen before. While many of these models can achieve better-than-human performance on narrow \\ntasks such as image labeling, even the best models can fail in unpredictable ways. For example, for many \\nimage labeling models it is possible to create images that clearly appear to be random noise to a human \\nbut will be falsely labeled as a specific object with high confidence by a trained model.16   \\nAnother challenge in using machine learning is that it is typically not possible to extract or generate a \\nstraightforward explanation for why a particular trained model is effective. Because trained models have a \\nvery large number of adjustable parameters—often hundreds of millions or more—training may yield a \\nmodel that \"works,\" in the sense of matching the data, but is not necessarily the simplest model that \\nworks. In human decision-making, any opacity in the process is typically due to not having enough \\ninformation about why a decision was reached, because the decider may be unable to articulate why the \\ndecision “felt right.”  With machine learning, everything about the decision procedure is known with \\nmathematical precision, but there may be simply too much information to interpret clearly.  \\nDeep Learning \\nIn recent years, some of the most impressive advancements in machine learning have been in the subfield \\nof deep learning, also known as deep network learning. Deep learning uses structures loosely inspired by \\nthe human brain, consisting of a set of units (or “neurons”). Each unit combines a set of input values to \\nproduce an output value, which in turn is passed on to other neurons downstream. For example, in an \\nimage recognition application, a first layer of units might combine the raw data of the image to recognize \\nsimple patterns in the image; a second layer of units might combine the results of the first layer to \\nrecognize patterns-of-patterns; a third layer might combine the results of the second layer; and so on. \\n                                                           \\n16 See, e.g., Ian J.

The dramatic success of \\nthese very large networks at many machine learning tasks has come as a surprise to some experts, and is \\nthe main cause of the current wave of enthusiasm for machine learning among AI researchers and \\npractitioners. \\nAutonomy and Automation  \\nAI is often applied to systems that can control physical actuators or trigger online actions. When AI \\ncomes into contact with the everyday world, issues of autonomy, automation, and human-machine \\nteaming arise. \\nAutonomy refers to the ability of a system to operate and adapt to changing circumstances with reduced or \\nwithout human control. For example, an autonomous car could drive itself to its destination. Despite the \\nfocus in much of the literature on cars and aircraft, autonomy is a much broader concept that includes \\nscenarios such as automated financial trading and automated content curation systems. Autonomy also \\nincludes systems that can diagnose and repair faults in their own operation, such as identifying and fixing \\nsecurity vulnerabilities. \\nAutomation occurs when a machine does work that might previously have been done by a person.17 The \\nterm relates to both physical work and mental or cognitive work that might be replaced by AI. \\nAutomation, and its impact on employment, have been significant social and economic phenomena since \\nat least the Industrial Revolution. It is widely accepted that AI will automate some jobs, but there is more \\ndebate about whether this is just the next chapter in the history of automation or whether AI will affect the \\neconomy differently than past waves of automation have previously. \\nHuman-Machine Teaming \\nIn contrast to automation, where a machine substitutes for human work, in some cases a machine will \\ncomplement human work. This may happen as a side-effect of AI development, or a system might be \\ndeveloped specifically with the goal of creating a human-machine team. Systems that aim to complement \\nhuman cognitive capabilities are sometimes referred to as intelligence augmentation.  \\nIn many applications, a human-machine team can be more effective than either one alone, using the \\nstrengths of one to compensate for the weaknesses of the other. One example is in chess playing, where a \\nweaker computer can often beat a stronger computer player, if the weaker computer is given a human \\nteammate—this is true even though top computers are much stronger players than any human.18 Another \\nexample is in radiology. In one recent study, given images of lymph node cells, and asked to determine \\n                                                           \\n17 Different definitions of “automation” are used in different settings. The definition used in the main text, involving \\nthe substitution of machine labor for human labor, is commonly used in economics. Another definition is used in the \\nsystems analysis setting in the Department of Defense (DoD): Automation means that the system functions with \\nlittle or no human operator involvement. However the system performance is limited to the specific pre -programmed \\nactions it has been designed to execute. Once the system is initiated by a human operator, it executes its task \\naccording to those instructions and subroutines, which have been tested and validated. Typically these are well -\\ndefined tasks that have predetermined responses, i.e., rule-based responses in reasonably well-known and structured \\nenvironments.  \\n18 Garry Kasparov, “The Chess Master and the Computer,” New York Review of Books, February 11, 2010. \\nhttp://www.nybooks.com/articles/2010/02/11/the-chess-master-and-the-computer.

The promise of AI has been \\ncompared to the transformative impacts of advances in mobile computing.21 Public- and private-sector \\ninvestments in basic and applied R&D on AI have already begun reaping major benefits for the public in \\nfields as diverse as health care, transportation, the environment, criminal justice, and economic \\ninclusion.22 \\nAt Walter Reed Medical Center, the Department of Veteran Affairs is using AI to better predict medical \\ncomplications and improve treatment of severe combat wounds, leading to better patient outcomes, faster \\nhealing, and lower costs.23 The same general approach—predicting complications to enable preventive \\ntreatment—has also reduced hospital-acquired infections at Johns Hopkins University.24 Given the current \\ntransition to electronic health records, predictive analysis of health data may play a key role across many \\nhealth domains like precision medicine and cancer research.   \\nIn transportation, AI-enabled smarter traffic management applications are reducing wait times, energy \\nuse, and emissions by as much as 25 percent in some places.25 Cities are now beginning to leverage the \\ntype of responsive dispatching and routing used by ride-hailing services, and linking it with scheduling \\nand tracking software for public transportation to provide just-in-time access to public transportation that \\ncan often be faster, cheaper and, in many cases, more accessible to the public.  \\nSome researchers are leveraging AI to improve animal migration tracking by using AI image \\nclassification software to analyze tourist photos from public social media sites. The software can identify \\nindividual animals in the photos and build a database of their migration using the data and location stamps \\non the photos.

The Administration is exploring how AI can responsibly \\nbenefit current initiatives such as Data Driven Justice and the Police Data Initiative that seek to provide \\nlaw enforcement and the public with data that can better inform decision-making in the criminal justice \\nsystem, while also taking care to minimize the possibility that AI might introduce bias or inaccuracies due \\nto deficiencies in the available data. \\nSeveral U.S. academic institutions have launched initiatives to use AI to tackle economic and social \\nchallenges.

These policies and practices may include: \\n\\uf0b7 investing in basic and applied research and development (R&D); \\n\\uf0b7 serving as an early customer for AI technologies and their applications; \\n\\uf0b7 supporting pilot projects and creating testbeds in real-world settings;  \\n\\uf0b7 making data sets available to the public;  \\n\\uf0b7 sponsoring incentive prizes; \\n\\uf0b7 identifying and pursuing Grand Challenges to set ambitious but achievable goals for AI; \\n\\uf0b7 funding rigorous evaluations of AI applications to measure their impact and cost-effectiveness; \\nand \\n\\uf0b7 creating a policy, legal, and regulatory environment that allows innovation to flourish while \\nprotecting the public from harm. \\nUsing AI in Government to Improve Services and Benefit the American People  \\nOne challenge in using AI to improve services is that the Federal Government’s capacity to foster and \\nharness innovation in order to better serve the country varies widely across agencies. Some agencies are \\nmore focused on innovation, particularly those agencies with large R&D budgets, a workforce that \\nincludes many scientists and engineers, a culture of innovation and experimentation, and strong ongoing \\ncollaborations with private-sector innovators. Many also have organizations that are specifically tasked \\nwith supporting high-risk, high-return research (e.g., the advanced research projects agencies in the \\nDepartments of Defense and Energy, as well as the Intelligence Community), and fund R&D across the \\nfull range from basic research to advanced development. Other agencies like the NSF have research and \\ndevelopment as their primary mission. \\nBut some agencies, particularly those charged with reducing poverty and increasing economic and social \\nmobility, have more modest levels of relevant capabilities, resources, and expertise.30 For example, while \\nthe National Institutes of Health (NIH) has an R&D budget of more than $30 billion, the Department of \\nLabor’s R&D budget is only $14 million. This limits the Department of Labor’s capacity to explore \\napplications of AI, such as applying AI-based “digital tutor” technology to increase the skills and incomes \\nof non-college educated workers.  \\nDARPA’s “Education Dominance” program serves as an example of AI’s potential to fulfill and \\naccelerate agency priorities. DARPA, intending to reduce from years to months the time required for new \\nNavy recruits to become experts in technical skills, now sponsors the development of a digital tutor that \\nuses AI to model the interaction between an expert and a novice. An evaluation of the digital tutor \\nprogram concluded that Navy recruits using the digital tutor to become IT systems administrators \\nfrequently outperform Navy experts with 7-10 years of experience in both written tests of knowledge and \\nreal-world problem solving.31  \\nPreliminary evidence based on digital tutor pilot projects also suggests that workers who have completed \\na training program that uses the digital tutor are more likely to get a high-tech job that dramatically \\n                                                           \\n30 Thomas Kalil, “A Broader Vision for Government Research,” Issues in Science and Technology, 2003. \\n31 “Winning the Education Future: The Role of ARPA-ED,” The U.S. Department of Education, March 8 2011, \\nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/arpa-ed-factsheet.pdf.

How will the incorporation \\nof AI into these products affect the relevant regulatory approaches?  In general, the approach to regulation \\nof AI-enabled products to protect public safety should be informed by assessment of the aspects of risk \\nthat the addition of AI may reduce, alongside the aspects of risk that it may increase. If a risk falls within \\nthe bounds of an existing regulatory regime, moreover, the policy discussion should start by considering \\nwhether the existing regulations already adequately address the risk, or whether they need to be adapted \\nto the addition of AI. Also, where regulatory responses to the addition of AI threaten to increase the cost \\nof compliance or slow the development or adoption of beneficial innovations, policymakers should \\nconsider how those responses could be adjusted to lower costs and barriers to innovation without \\nadversely impacting safety or market fairness. \\nThe general consensus of the RFI commenters was that broad regulation of AI research or practice would \\nbe inadvisable at this time.34 Instead, commenters said that the goals and structure of existing regulations \\nwere sufficient, and commenters called for existing regulation to be adapted as necessary to account for \\nthe effects of AI. For example, commenters suggested that motor vehicle regulation should evolve to \\naccount for the anticipated arrival of autonomous vehicles, and that the necessary evolution could be \\ncarried out within the current structure of vehicle safety regulation. In doing so, agencies must remain \\nmindful of the fundamental purposes and goals of regulation to safeguard the public good, while creating \\nspace for innovation and growth in AI. \\nEffective regulation of technologies such as AI requires agencies to have in-house technical expertise to \\nhelp guide regulatory decision-making. The need for senior-level expert participation exists at regulating \\ndepartments and agencies, and at all stages of the regulatory process. A range of personnel assignment \\nand exchange models (e.g. hiring authorities) can be used to develop a Federal workforce with more \\ndiverse perspectives on the current state of technological development. One example of such an authority \\nis the Intergovernmental Personnel Act (IPA) Mobility Program, which provides for the temporary \\nassignment of personnel between the Federal Government and state and local governments, colleges and \\nuniversities, Indian tribal governments, federally funded research and development centers, and other \\neligible organizations. If used strategically, the IPA program can help agencies meet their needs for hard-\\nto-fill positions and increase their ability to hire candidates from diverse technical backgrounds. Federal \\nemployees serving in IPA assignments can serve as both recruiters and ambassadors for the Federal \\nworkforce. For example, agency staff sent to colleges and universities as instructors can inspire students \\nto consider Federal employment. Likewise, programs that rotate employees through different jobs and \\nsectors can help government employees gain knowledge and experience to inform regulation and policy, \\nespecially as it relates to emergent technologies like AI.  \\n                                                           \\n34 Ed Felten and Terah Lyons, “Public Input and Next Steps on the Future of Artificial Intelligence.” '),\n",

Within DOT, automated cars are regulated \\nby the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and aircraft are regulated by the \\nFederal Aviation Administration (FAA).  \\nThe Promise of Autonomy \\nThe application of AI to vehicles and aircraft has captured the public imagination. Today’s new cars have \\nAI-based driver assist features like self-parking and advanced cruise controls that keep a car in its lane \\nand adjust speed based on surrounding vehicles. Experimental fully automated cars monitored by humans \\ncan already be seen driving on the roads. The consensus of experts is that automated surface vehicle \\ntechnology will eventually be safer than human drivers and may someday prevent most of the tens of \\nthousands of fatalities that occur annually on the Nation’s roads and highways. \\nAutomated vehicles also offer the possibility of greater mobility for the elderly and Americans with \\ndisabilities who may not be able to drive. First- and last-mile access to transit and other novel \\ntransportation approaches may provide communities isolated from essential services such as jobs, health \\ncare, and groceries unprecedented access to opportunity. A well-designed system of automated vehicles \\nable to predict and avoid collisions may also significantly reduce transportation-related emissions and \\nenergy consumption. The Administration is taking steps to make this vision a reality, including the \\nproposed $3.9 billion investment in the President’s Fiscal Year (FY) 2017 Budget by the Department of \\nTransportation in automated and connected vehicle research, development, and deployment efforts, to \\nensure that the United States maintains its lead in automated vehicle technologies.35  \\n                                                           \\n35 “Secretary Foxx Unveils President Obama’s FY17 Budget Proposal of Nearly $4 Billion for Automated Vehicles \\nand Announces DOT Initiatives to Accelerate Vehicle Safety Innovations,” U.S. Department of Transportation, \\nJanuary 14 2016, https://www.transportation.gov/briefing-room/secretary-foxx-unveils-president-\\nobama%E2%80%99s-fy17-budget-proposal-nearly-4-billion. \\nRecommendation 5: Agencies should draw on appropriate technical expertise at the senior level \\nwhen setting regulatory policy for AI-enabled products. Effective regulation of AI-enabled products \\nrequires collaboration between agency leadership, staff knowledgeable about the existing regulatory \\nframework and regulatory practices generally, and technical experts with knowledge of AI. Agency \\nleadership should take steps to recruit the necessary technical talent, or identify it in existing agency \\nstaff, and should ensure that there are sufficient technical “seats at the table” in regulatory policy \\ndiscussions.  \\n \\nRecommendation 6: Agencies should use the full range of personnel assignment and exchange \\nmodels (e.g. hiring authorities) to foster a Federal workforce with more diverse perspectives on the \\ncurrent state of technology.  \\n '),\n",

But in recent years, potential applications have rapidly \\nexpanded to include aerial photography, surveying land and crops, monitoring forest fires, responding to \\ndisasters, and inspecting critical infrastructure. Several government agencies are already operating UAS \\nto advance their missions, and thousands of Americans have obtained the necessary authority from the \\nFederal Aviation Administration (FAA) for commercial UAS operations, a process accelerated under the \\nFAA’s “Small UAS Rule” that took effect in August 2016 and the FAA’s Small UAS Aircraft \\nRegistration Service that launched in December 2015. The FAA estimates that the number of UAS \\nregistered for commercial use will exceed 600,000 by August 2017.37  \\nOne estimate of the economic impact of integrating of UAS into the airspace predicted more than $13.6 \\nbillion of economic value created by UAS in the first three years of integration, with sustainable growth \\npredicted to follow.38 A 2013 study from the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International \\npredicted that the commercial drone industry could generate more than $82 billion for the U.S. economy \\nand create more than 100,000 new jobs over the next 10 years. Tax revenue to the states was predicted to \\nincrease by more than $482 million in the first decade after integration.39  \\nEnsuring Safety \\nRealizing the potential benefits of these promising technologies requires that government take steps to \\nensure the safety of the airspace and roads, while continuing to foster a culture of innovation and growth. \\nThe United States has the safest and most complex aviation system in the world, and the public relies on \\nFAA oversight to establish safety standards. Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS) place \\nrequirements on manufacturers to develop safe surface vehicles, and NHTSA has the authority to recall \\nvehicles in the event of an unreasonable risk to safety. While there is considerable opportunity to reduce \\nthe fatalities on roads and highways, current practices result in approximately one fatality for every 100 \\nmillion vehicle miles traveled. Equaling or exceeding such performance in automated vehicles is a \\nformidable challenge. \\nApplying techniques of AI in such safety-critical environments raises several challenges. First among \\nthese is the need to translate human responsibilities while driving or flying into software. Unlike in some \\nother successful applications of Narrow AI, there are no concise descriptions for the task of operating \\nground or air vehicles. Each of these operations is multifaceted, with responsibilities including guiding \\nthe vehicle, detecting and avoiding obstacles, and handing mechanical failures such as flat tires. While \\nsubtasks such as navigation or certain types of perception may align with certain existing Narrow AI \\nsolutions, the integration and prioritization of these tasks may not. It may seem straightforward to simply \\nobey all traffic laws, but a skilled human driver may cross a double-yellow road boundary to avoid an \\naccident or move past a double-parked vehicle. Though such situations may be rare, they cannot be \\n                                                           \\n36 The National Airspace System is the network of air navigation facilities, air traffic control facilities, airports, \\ntechnology, and rules and regulations that are needed to protect persons and property on the ground, and to establish \\na safe and efficient airspace environment for civil, commercial, and military aviation. \\n37 “Aerospace Forecast Report Fiscal Years 2016 to 2036,” The Federal Aviation Administration, March 24 016, \\nhttps://www.faa.gov/data_research/aviation/aerospace_forecasts/media/Unmanned_Aircraft_Systems.pdf.  \\n38 Derryl Jenkins and Bijan Vasigh, “The Economic Impact of Unmanned Aircraft Systems Integration in the United \\nStates,” The Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International, 2013, \\nhttps://higherlogicdownload.s3.amazonaws.com/AUVSI/958c920a -7f9b-4ad2-9807-\\nf9a4e95d1ef1/UploadedImages/New_Economic%20Report%202013%20Full.pdf. \\n39 Ibid.

Machine learning approaches can be more confident that a case will be handled \\ncorrectly if a similar case is in the training set. The challenge is how to develop a data set that includes \\nenough of the rare cases that contribute to the risk of an accident. Commercial aviation has mechanisms \\nfor sharing incident and safety data across the industry, but reporting may not be second nature to recently \\ncredentialed UAS operators who are new to the safety and accountability culture of the traditional \\naviation industry. No comparable system currently exists for the automotive industry—only fatal \\naccidents are reported, and the collection and reporting of other traffic safety information is done, if at all, \\nin a disparate manner at the state or local level. The lack of consistently reported incident or near-miss \\ndata increases the number of miles or hours of operation necessary to establish system safety, presenting \\nan obstacle to certain AI approaches that require extensive testing for validation.  \\nTo facilitate safe testing, the FAA has designated six UAS Test Sites across the country and provided \\nblanket authorization for UAS operations within these sites. Activities at the sites include a project to \\nextend NASA’s multi-year research on UAS traffic management (UTM) to identify operational \\nrequirements for large-scale beyond visual line-of-sight UAS operations in low-altitude airspace. \\nSimilarly, ground vehicle testbeds such as the Connected Vehicle Pilots and the deployment of automated \\nvehicles in Columbus, Ohio, winner of the Department of Transportation’s $40 million Smart City \\nChallenge in 2016, will provide rich baseline and interaction data for AI researchers. \\n \\nAdapting Current Regulations \\nWhile the regulatory approaches for the Nation’s airspace and highways differ, the approaches to \\nintegrating autonomous vehicles and aircraft share a common goal: both the FAA and NHTSA are \\nworking to establish nimble and flexible frameworks that ensure safety while encouraging innovation.  \\nWith respect to airspace regulation, a significant step toward enabling the safe integration of UAS into the \\nairspace was the FAA’s promulgation of the Part 107, or “Small UAS,” final rule, which took effect on \\nAugust 29, 2016. For the first time, the rule authorizes widespread non-recreational flights of UAS under \\n55 pounds. The rule limits flights to daytime, at an altitude of 400 feet or less, with the vehicle controlled \\nby a licensed operator and within the operator’s direct line of sight. Flights over people are not allowed. \\nSubsequent rules are planned, to relax these restrictions as experience and data show how to do so safely. \\nIn particular, DOT is currently developing a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking proposing a regime for \\ncertain types of “micro UAS” to conduct operations over people, with a rule on expanded operations \\nexpected to follow.  \\nThe FAA has not yet publicly announced a clear path to a regulation allowing fully autonomous40 flight. \\nThough safe integration of autonomous aircraft into the airspace will be a complex process, the FAA is \\n                                                           \\n40 This report uses the term “autonomous” for an aircraft that is controlled by a machine rather than a human. \\n“Piloted” refers to an aircraft that has a human onboard who is controlling the aircraft. “Remotely-piloted” refers to \\nRecommendation 7: The Department of Transportation should work with industry and researchers \\non ways to increase sharing of data for safety, research, and other purposes.

In addition, Stanford’s One-Hundred Year Study on \\nArtificial Intelligence48 plans to conduct \"a series of periodic studies on how AI will affect automation, \\nnational security, psychology, ethics, law, privacy, democracy, and other issues.\" The first of these studies \\nwas published in September 2016.49 \\nOne potentially useful line of research is to survey expert judgments over time. As one example, a survey \\nof AI researchers found that 80 percent of respondents believed that human-level General AI will \\neventually be achieved, and half believed it is at least 50 percent likely to be achieved by the year 2040. \\nMost respondents also believed that General AI will eventually surpass humans in general intelligence.50 \\nWhile these particular predictions are highly uncertain, as discussed above, such surveys of expert \\njudgment are useful, especially when they are repeated frequently enough to measure changes in \\njudgment over time.

If competition drives \\ncommercial labs towards increased secrecy, monitoring of progress may become more difficult, and \\npublic concern may increase.  \\nOne particularly valuable line of research is to identify milestones that could represent or foreshadow \\nsignificant leaps in AI capabilities. When asked during the outreach workshops and meetings how \\ngovernment could recognize milestones of progress in the field, especially those that indicate the arrival \\nof General AI may be approaching, researchers tended to give three distinct but related types of answers:  \\n1. Success at broader, less structured tasks: In this view, the transition from present Narrow AI to \\nan eventual General AI will occur by gradually broadening the capabilities of Narrow AI systems \\nso that a single system can cover a wider range of less structured tasks. An example milestone in \\nthis area would be a housecleaning robot that is as capable as a person at the full range of routine \\nhousecleaning tasks. \\n \\n2. Unification of different “styles” of AI methods: In this view, AI currently relies on a set of \\nseparate methods or approaches, each useful for different types of applications. The path to \\nGeneral AI would involve a progressive unification of these methods. A milestone would involve \\nfinding a single method that is able to address a larger domain of applications that previously \\nrequired multiple methods. \\n \\n3. Solving specific technical challenges, such as transfer learning: In this view, the path to General \\nAI does not lie in progressive broadening of scope, nor in unification of existing methods, but in \\nprogress on specific technical grand challenges, opening up new ways forward. The most \\ncommonly cited challenge is transfer learning, which has the goal of creating a machine learning \\nalgorithm whose result can be broadly applied (or transferred) to a range of new applications. For \\nexample, transfer learning might allow a model to be trained to translate English to Spanish, in \\nsuch a way that the resulting model could “transfer” its knowledge to similar tasks such as \\nChinese to French translation, or writing poetry in Russian, enabling these new tasks to be \\nlearned much more quickly. \\n                                                           \\n52 Sara Reardon, “Text-mining offers clues to success: US intelligence programme analyses language in patents and \\npapers to identify next big technologies,” Nature no. 509, 410 (May 22 2014). \\nRecommendation 10: The NSTC Subcommittee on Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence \\nshould monitor developments in AI, and report regularly to senior Administration leadership about \\nthe status of AI, especially with regard to milestones. The Subcommittee should update the list of \\nmilestones as knowledge advances and the consensus of experts changes over time.  The \\nSubcommittee should consider reporting to the public on AI developments, when appropriate. \\n \\nRecommendation 11: The Government should monitor the state of AI in other countries, especially \\nwith respect to milestones.  \\n \\nRecommendation 12: Industry should work with government to keep government updated on the \\ngeneral progress of AI in industry, including the likelihood of milestones being reached soon.  \\n '),\n",

At the same time they emphasized that there are many \\ndeep unanswered questions, and no clear path toward General AI.  \\nResearchers reported that enthusiasm for and investment in AI research has fluctuated over recent \\ndecades—one low period was known as the “AI winter”—and they emphasized the importance of \\nsustained investment given the history of major computer science advances taking 15 years or more to \\ntransition from conception in the lab to industrial maturity.  \\nA strong case can be made in favor of increased Federal funding for research in AI. Analysis by the \\nCouncil of Economic Advisers (CEA) indicates that beyond AI, across all research areas, doubling or \\ntripling research investment would be a net positive for the Nation due to the resulting increase in \\neconomic growth.53 Although it may not be feasible fiscally to increase funding for all research by that \\namount, a targeted increase in areas of high economic and strategic value may offer many benefits with \\nmuch smaller budgetary impact than an across-the-board increase. AI qualifies as a high-leverage area, \\nand research agencies report that the AI research community can absorb a significant funding increase \\nproductively, leading to faster progress on AI and a larger cadre of trained AI practitioners. In a speech \\ndelivered at an AI workshop in New York City in July 2016, CEA Chairman Jason Furman said, “We \\nhave had substantial innovation in robotics, AI, and other areas in the last decade. But we will need a \\nmuch faster pace of innovation in these areas to really move the dial on productivity growth going \\nforward,” noting that the biggest worry that he had about AI is “that we do not have enough of [it].”54  \\n \\nTo be sure, the private sector will be the main engine of progress on AI. But as it stands, there is an \\nunderinvestment in basic research—research with long time horizons conducted for the sole purpose of \\nfurthering the scientific knowledge base—in part because it is difficult for a private firm to get a return \\nfrom its investment in such research in a reasonable time frame. Basic research benefits everyone, but \\nonly the firm doing the research pays the costs.

Government must understand the potential impacts so it can put \\nin place policies and institutions that will support the benefits of AI, while mitigating the costs.60 \\n \\nLike past waves of innovation, AI will create both benefits and costs. The primary benefit of previous \\nwaves of automation has been productivity growth; today’s wave of automation is no different. For \\nexample, a 2015 study of robots in 17 countries found that they added an estimated 0.4 percentage point \\non average to those countries’ annual GDP growth between 1993 and 2007, accounting for just over one-\\ntenth of those countries’ overall GDP growth during that time.61 \\n \\nOne important concern arising from prior waves of automation, however, is the potential impact on \\ncertain types of jobs and sectors, and the resulting impacts on income inequality.  Because AI has the \\npotential to eliminate or drive down wages of some jobs, especially low- and medium-skill jobs, policy \\ninterventions will likely be needed to ensure that AI’s economic benefits are broadly shared and that \\ninequality is diminished and not worsened as a consequence. \\n \\nThe economic policy questions raised by AI-driven automation are important but they are best addressed \\nby a separate White House working group.

The use of AI to make consequential decisions about people, often \\nreplacing decisions made by human actors and institutions, leads to concerns about how to ensure justice, \\nfairness, and accountability—the same concerns voiced previously in the “Big Data” context.62 The use of \\nAI to control physical-world equipment leads to concerns about safety, especially as systems are exposed \\nto the full complexity of the human environment.  \\nAt a technical level, the challenges of fairness and safety are related. In both cases, practitioners strive to \\nprevent intentional discrimination or failure, to avoid unintended consequences, and to generate the \\nevidence needed to give stakeholders justified confidence that unintended failures are unlikely. \\nJustice, Fairness, and Accountability \\nA common theme in the Law and Governance, AI for Social Good, and Social and Economic Impacts \\nworkshops was the need to ensure that AI promotes justice and fairness, and that AI-based processes are \\naccountable to stakeholders. This issue was highlighted previously in the Administration’s first Big Data \\nreport63 published in May 2014, and the follow-up report on Big Data, Algorithmic Systems, Opportunity, \\nand Civil Rights,64 published in May 2016. \\nIn the criminal justice system, some of the biggest concerns with Big Data are the lack of data and the \\nlack of quality data.65 AI needs good data. If the data is incomplete or biased, AI can exacerbate problems \\nof bias.

If a machine learning model is used to screen job applicants, \\nand if the data used to train the model reflects past decisions that are biased, the result could be to \\nperpetuate past bias. For example, looking for candidates who resemble past hires may bias a system \\ntoward hiring more people like those already on a team, rather than considering the best candidates across \\nthe full diversity of potential applicants. \\nIn response to these concerns, several workshop speakers argued for greater transparency when AI tools \\nare used for public purposes. One speaker compared the role of AI to the role of administrative agencies \\nin public decision-making. Authority is delegated to an agency due to the agency’s subject-matter \\nexpertise, but the delegation is constrained by due process protections, measures promoting transparency \\nand oversight, and limits on the scope of the delegated authority. Some speakers called for the \\ndevelopment of an analogous theory of how to maintain accountability when delegating decision-making \\npower to machines. Transparency concerns focused not only on the data and algorithms used, but also on \\nthe potential to have some form of explanation for any AI-based determination.  \\nAt the same workshops, AI experts cautioned that there are inherent challenges in trying to understand, \\npredict, and explain the behavior of advanced AI systems, due to the complexity of the systems and the \\nlarge volume of data they use. \\nThe difficulty of understanding machine learning results is at odds with the common misconception that \\ncomplex algorithms always do what their designers choose to have them do, and therefore that bias will \\ncreep into an algorithm if and only if its developers themselves suffer from conscious or unconscious \\nbias. It is certainly true that a technology developer who wants to produce a biased algorithm can do so, \\nand that unconscious bias may cause practitioners to apply insufficient effort to preventing bias. In \\npractice, however, unbiased developers with the best intentions can inadvertently produce systems with \\nbiased results, because even the developers of an AI system may not understand it well enough to prevent \\nunintended outcomes. \\nMoritz Hardt suggested an illustrative example of how bias might emerge unintentionally from the \\nmachine learning process.68 He postulated a machine learning model trained to distinguish people’s real \\nnames from false names.69 The model might determine that a name is more likely to be false if the first-\\nname part of it is unique in the data set. This rule might have predictive power across the whole \\npopulation, because false names are more likely to be fanciful and therefore unique. However, if there is \\nan ethnic group that is a small minority of the population and tends to use a different set of first names \\nthan the majority population, these distinctive names are more likely to be unique in the sample, and \\ntherefore more likely to be incorrectly classified as false names. This effect would arise not because of \\nany special treatment of the minority group’s names, and not because the input data is unrepresentative of \\nthe overall population, but simply because the minority group is less numerous.70  \\nAndrew Moore, the Dean of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University, offered a perspective on \\nthe challenge of AI and unforeseen consequences at the workshop on AI Technology, Safety, and Control. \\n                                                           \\n68 Moritz Hardt, “How big data is unfair,” Medium, September 26 2014, https://medium.com/@mrtz/how-big-data-\\nis-unfair-9aa544d739de. \\n69 Some online services require that users sign up for accounts using their real names. Some such services use AI \\nmodels to detect names suspected of being false, in order to cancel the associated accounts. In such a system, a user \\nwhose name is incorrectly classified as false may be unable to sign up for an account, or may have their account \\ncanceled unexpectedly. \\n70 Hardt points to another way that disparate impact may occur. ML models typically become more accurate as the \\nnumber of examples in the training set increases. In some circumstances, this may cause prediction to be more \\naccurate for a majority group than for a minority. Again, this disparity arises simply because the majority group is \\nmore numerous, even if the dataset is representative of the population.  '),\n",

This was antithetical to the developers’ values, and it occurred despite testing \\nthat showed the model produced accurate results on a high percentage of all photos. These particular \\nerrors, although rare, had negative consequences that were beyond the understanding of the model, which \\nhad no built-in concept of race, nor any understanding of the relevant historical context. One way to \\nprevent this type of error would have involved extensive testing of the algorithm to scrutinize how human \\nfaces, in particular, are labeled, including examination of some results by people who could recognize \\nunacceptable outcomes that the model wouldn’t catch.  \\nEthical training for AI practitioners and students is a necessary part of the solution. Ideally, every student \\nlearning AI, computer science, or data science would be exposed to curriculum and discussion on related \\nethics and security topics.71 However, ethics alone is not sufficient. Ethics can help practitioners \\nunderstand their responsibilities to all stakeholders, but ethical training needs to be augmented with the \\ntechnical capability to put good intentions into practice by taking technical precautions as a system is built \\nand tested. \\nAs practitioners strive to make AI systems more just, fair and accountable, there are often opportunities to \\nmake technology an aid to accountability rather than a barrier to it. Research to improve the \\ninterpretability of machine learning results is one example. Having an interpretable model that helps \\npeople understand a decision empowers them to interrogate the assumptions and processes behind it.  \\nThere are several technical approaches to enhancing the accountability and robustness of complex \\nalgorithmic decisions. A system can be tested “in the wild” by presenting it with situations and observing \\nits behavior. A system can be subjected to black-box testing, in which it is presented with synthetic inputs \\nand its behavior is observed, enabling behavior to be tested in scenarios that might not occur naturally.72 \\nSome or all of the technical details of a system’s design can be published, enabling analysts to replicate it \\nand analyze aspects of its internal behavior that might be difficult to characterize with testing alone. In \\nsome cases it is possible to publish information that helps the public evaluate a system’s risk of bias, \\nwhile withholding other information about the system as proprietary or private.  \\nSafety and Control \\nAt the workshops, AI experts said that one of the main factors limiting the deployment of AI in the real \\nworld is concern about safety and control. If practitioners cannot achieve justified confidence that a \\nsystem is safe and controllable, so that deploying the system does not create an unacceptable risk of \\nserious negative consequences, then the system cannot and should not be deployed. \\n                                                           \\n71 Some institutions may choose to incorporate ethics into existing courses. Others may choose to introduce separate \\ncourses on ethics. \\n72 Black-box testing allows a system to be presented with fictionalized data, which enables comprehensive \\nexperiments that vary individual attributes of an individual as well as larger numbers of experiments than might be \\npossible for in-the-wild testing.

In the \\nopen world, a system is likely to encounter objects and situations that were not anticipated when it was \\ndesigned and built. Adapting gracefully to unforeseen situations is difficult yet necessary for safe \\noperation. \\nOn the topic of safety and predictability in AI, several speakers referenced a recent paper entitled \\n“Concrete Problems in AI Safety,”73 and the first author of the paper spoke at the workshop on \\nTechnology, Safety, and Control. The paper uses a running example of an autonomous robot that does \\nhousecleaning. The paper’s overview section gives an extended list of the sorts of practical problems that \\narise in making such a robot effective and safe, which is quoted here: \\nAvoiding Negative Side Effects: How can we ensure that our cleaning robot will not disturb the \\nenvironment in negative ways while pursuing its goals, e.g., by knocking over a vase because it \\ncan clean faster by doing so? Can we do this without manually specifying everything the robot \\nshould not disturb? \\nAvoiding Reward Hacking: How can we ensure that the cleaning robot won’t game its reward \\nfunction? For example, if we reward the robot for achieving an environment free of messes, it \\nmight disable its vision so that it won’t find any messes, or cover over messes with materials it \\ncan’t see through, or simply hide when humans are around so they can’t tell it about new types of \\nmesses. \\nScalable Oversight: How can we efficiently ensure that the cleaning robot respects aspects of the \\nobjective that are too expensive to be frequently evaluated during training? For instance, it should \\nthrow out things that are unlikely to belong to anyone, but put aside things that might belong to \\nsomeone (it should handle stray candy wrappers differently from stray cellphones). Asking the \\nhumans involved whether they lost anything can serve as a check on this, but this check might \\nhave to be relatively infrequent—can the robot find a way to do the right thing despite limited \\ninformation? \\nSafe Exploration: How do we ensure that the cleaning robot doesn’t make exploratory moves \\nwith very bad repercussions? For example, the robot should experiment with mopping strategies, \\nbut putting a wet mop in an electrical outlet is a very bad idea. \\nRobustness to Distributional Shift: How do we ensure that the cleaning robot recognizes, and \\nbehaves robustly, when in an environment different from its training environment? For example, \\nheuristics it learned for cleaning factory work floors may be outright dangerous in an office. \\nThese examples illustrate how the “intelligence” of an AI system can be deep but narrow: the system \\nmight have a superhuman ability to detect dirt and optimize its mopping strategy, yet not know to avoid \\nswiping a wet mop over an electrical outlet. One way to describe this overall problem is: how can we give \\nintelligent machines common sense? Researchers are making slow progress on these sorts of problems. \\nAI Safety Engineering \\nA common theme at the Technology, Safety, and Control workshop was the need to connect open-world \\nAI methods with the broader field of safety engineering. Experience in building other types of safety-\\ncritical systems, such as aircraft, power plants, bridges, and vehicles, has much to teach AI practitioners \\nabout verification and validation, how to build a safety case for a technology, how to manage risk, and \\nhow to communicate with stakeholders about risk. \\n                                                           \\n73 Dario Amodei, Chris Olah, Jacob Steinhardt, Paul Christiano, John Schulman, and Dan Mané, “Concrete \\nProblems in AI Safety,” https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06565.

The State Department foresees privacy concerns, \\nsafety of autonomous vehicles, and AI’s impact on long-term employment trends as AI-related policy \\nareas to watch in the international context. \\nIn support of U.S. foreign policy priorities in this space—including ensuring U.S. international leadership \\nand economic competitiveness—the U.S. Government has engaged on AI R&D and policy issues in \\nbilateral discussions with other countries, including Japan, the Republic of Korea, Germany, Poland, the \\nUnited Kingdom, and Italy, as well as in multilateral fora. International AI policy issues and the economic \\nimpacts of AI have also been raised in the UN, the G-7, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and \\nDevelopment (OECD), and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC). The U.S. Government \\nexpects AI to be a topic of increasing interest in international engagements. \\nThe United States has been committed to working with industry and relevant standards organizations, in \\norder to facilitate the development of international standards in a manner that is industry-led; voluntary; \\nconsensus-driven; and based on principles of transparency, openness, and market needs. The U.S. \\napproach is formalized in law (NTTAA, PL 104-113) and policy (OMB Circular A-119) and reiterated in \\nthe United States Standards Strategy.75 \\n                                                           \\n75 United States Standards Strategy Committee, \"United States standards strategy,\" New York: American National \\nStandards Institute (2015), \\nhttps://share.ansi.org/shared%20documents/Standards%20Activities/NSSC/USSS_Third_edition/ANSI_USSS_2015\\n.pdf. \\nRecommendation 20: The U.S. Government should develop a government-wide strategy on \\ninternational engagement related to AI, and develop a list of AI topical areas that need \\ninternational engagement and monitoring.  \\n \\nRecommendation 21: The U.S. Government should deepen its engagement with key international \\nstakeholders, including foreign governments, international organizations, industry, academia, and \\nothers, to exchange information and facilitate collaboration on AI R&D.  \\n \\n '),\n",

Automating this expert work, partially or entirely, may enable strong security across a much \\nbroader range of systems and applications at dramatically lower cost, and may increase the agility of \\ncyber defenses. Using AI may help maintain the rapid response required to detect and react to the \\nlandscape of ever evolving cyber threats. There are many opportunities for AI and specifically machine \\nlearning systems to help cope with the sheer complexity of cyberspace and support effective human \\ndecision making in response to cyberattacks.  \\nFuture AI systems could perform predictive analytics to anticipate cyberattacks by generating dynamic \\nthreat models from available data sources that are voluminous, ever-changing, and often incomplete. \\nThese data include the topology and state of network nodes, links, equipment, architecture, protocols, and \\nnetworks. AI may be the most effective approach to interpreting these data, proactively identifying \\nvulnerabilities, and taking action to prevent or mitigate future attacks. \\nResults to-date in DARPA’s Cyber Grand Challenge (CGC) competition demonstrate the potential of this \\napproach.76 The CGC was designed to accelerate the development of advanced, autonomous systems that \\ncan detect, evaluate, and patch software vulnerabilities before adversaries have a chance to exploit them. \\nThe CGC Final Event was held on August 4, 2016. To fuel follow-on research and parallel competition, \\nall of the code produced by the automated systems during the CGC Final Event has been released as open \\nsource to allow others to reverse engineer it and learn from it. \\n \\nAI systems also have their own cybersecurity needs. AI-driven applications should implement sound \\ncybersecurity controls to ensure integrity of data and functionality, protect privacy and confidentiality, \\nand maintain availability. The recent Federal Cybersecurity R&D Strategic Plan77 highlighted the need for \\n“sustainably secure systems development and operation.” Advances in cybersecurity will be critical in \\nmaking AI solutions secure and resilient against malicious cyber activities, particularly as the volume and \\ntype of tasks conducted by governments and private sector businesses using Narrow AI increases. \\nFinally, AI could support planning, coordinating, integrating, synchronizing, and directing activities to \\noperate and defend U.S. government networks and systems effectively, provide assistance in support of \\nsecure operation of private-sector networks and systems, and enable action in accordance with all \\napplicable laws, regulations and treaties.  \\n \\n                                                           \\n76 https://www.cybergrandchallenge.com \\n77 “Federal Cybersecurity Research and Development Strategic Plan,” Executive Office of the President, February \\n2016, \\nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/documents/2016_Federal_Cybersecurity_Research_and_De\\nvelopment_Stratgeic_Plan.pdf.

Precision-guided munitions allow an operation to be completed with \\nfewer weapons expended and with less collateral damage, and remotely-piloted vehicles can lessen the \\nrisk to military personnel by placing greater distance between them and danger. Nonetheless, moving \\naway from direct human control of weapon systems involves some risks and can raise legal and ethical \\nquestions. The key to further incorporating autonomous and semi-autonomous weapon systems into U.S. \\ndefense planning and force structure is to continue ensuring that all our weapon systems, including \\nautonomous weapon systems, are being used in a manner consistent with international humanitarian law. \\nIn addition, the U.S. Government should continue taking appropriate steps to control proliferation, and \\nworking with partners and Allies to develop standards related to the development and use of such weapon \\nsystems. \\nOver the past several years, in particular, issues concerning the development of so-called “Lethal \\nAutonomous Weapon Systems” (LAWS) have been raised by technical experts, ethicists, and others in \\nthe international community.79 The United States has actively participated in the ongoing international \\ndiscussion on LAWS in the context of the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW),80 and \\nanticipates continued robust international discussion of these potential weapon systems going forward.  \\nState Parties to the CCW are discussing technical, legal, military, ethical, and other issues involved with \\nemerging technologies, although it is clear that there is no common understanding of LAWS. Some States \\nhave conflated LAWS with remotely piloted aircraft (military “drones”), a position which the United \\nStates opposes, as remotely-piloted craft are, by definition, directly controlled by humans just as manned \\naircraft are. Other States have focused on artificial intelligence, robot armies, or whether “meaningful \\nhuman control” – an undefined term – is exercised over life-and-death decisions. The U.S. priority has \\nbeen to reiterate that all weapon systems, autonomous or otherwise, must adhere to international \\n                                                           \\n78 See, e.g., Jeffrey L. Caton, “Autonomous Weapons Systems: A Brief Survey of Developmental, Operational, \\nLegal, and Ethical Issues,” Strategic Studies Institute, U.S. Army War College, December 2015, \\nhttp://www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pdffiles/PUB1309.pdf. \\n79 See, e.g., DeepMind comment, Human Rights Watch comment to the OSTP Request for Information on Artificial  \\nIntelligence. \\n80 The Convention on Prohibitions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons Which May Be Deemed to Be \\nExcessively Injurious or to Have Indiscriminate Effects (CCW) regulates certain weapons under its five Protocols. \\nThe States Parties to the CCW began informal discussions related to LAWS in 2014. \\nRecommendation 22: Agencies’ plans and strategies should account for the influence of AI on \\ncybersecurity, and of cybersecurity on AI. Agencies involved in AI issues should engage their U.S. \\nGovernment and private-sector cybersecurity colleagues for input on how to ensure that AI systems \\nand ecosystems are secure and resilient to intelligent adversaries.

The CCW will decide on whether and how to conduct future \\nmeetings on LAWS and associated issues during its Review Conference in December 2016. \\nThe U.S. government is also conducting a comprehensive review of the implications of autonomy in \\ndefense systems. In November 2012, the Department of Defense (DoD) issued DoD Directive 3000.09, \\n“Autonomy in Weapon Systems,” which outlines requirements for the development and fielding of \\nautonomous and semi-autonomous weapons. Weapon systems capable of autonomously selecting and \\nengaging targets with lethal force require senior-level DoD reviews and approval before those weapon \\nsystems enter formal development and again before fielding. The DoD Directive neither prohibits nor \\nencourages such development, but requires it to proceed carefully and only after review and approval by \\nsenior defense officials. Among other things, the DoD Directive requires that autonomous and semi-\\nautonomous weapon systems are rigorously tested and that personnel are trained appropriately in their use \\nto advance international norms pertaining to armed conflict.  \\nAI has the potential to provide significant benefits across a range of defense-related activities. Non-lethal \\nactivities such as logistics, maintenance, base operations, veterans’ healthcare, lifesaving battlefield \\nmedical assistance and casualty evacuation, personnel management, navigation, communication, cyber-\\ndefense, and intelligence analysis can benefit from AI, making American forces safer and more effective. \\nAI may also play an important role in new systems for protecting people and high-value fixed assets and \\ndeterring attacks through non-lethal means. Ultimately, these applications may turn out to be the most \\nimportant for DoD. \\nGiven advances in military technology and artificial intelligence more broadly, scientists, strategists, and \\nmilitary experts all agree that the future of LAWS is difficult to predict and the pace of change is rapid. \\nMany new capabilities may soon be possible, and quickly able to be developed and operationalized. The \\nAdministration is engaged in active, ongoing interagency discussions to work toward a government-wide \\npolicy on autonomous weapons consistent with shared human values, national security interests, and \\ninternational and domestic obligations. \\n \\n                                                           \\n81 The principle of distinction requires parties to a conflict to distinguish between the civilian population and \\ncombatants and between civilian objects and military objectives, and to direct their o perations only against military \\nobjectives. \\n82 The principle of proportionality prohibits attacks that may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, \\ninjury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof, which would be exces sive in relation to the \\nconcrete and direct military advantage anticipated. \\nRecommendation 23: The U.S. Government should complete the development of a single, \\ngovernment-wide policy, consistent with international humanitarian law, on autonomous and \\nsemi-autonomous weapons. \\n '),\n",

It should convene conversations about important issues and help to \\nset the agenda for public debate. It should monitor the safety and fairness of applications as they develop, \\nand adapt regulatory frameworks to encourage innovation while protecting the public. It should support \\nbasic research and the application of AI to public goods, as well as the development of a skilled, diverse \\nworkforce. And government should use AI itself, to serve the public faster, more effectively, and at lower \\ncost.  \\nMany areas of public policy, from education and the economic safety net, to defense, environmental \\npreservation, and criminal justice, will see new opportunities and new challenges driven by the continued \\nprogress of AI. Government must continue to build its capacity to understand and adapt to these changes. \\nAs the technology of AI continues to develop, practitioners must ensure that AI-enabled systems are \\ngovernable; that they are open, transparent, and understandable; that they can work effectively with \\npeople; and that their operation will remain consistent with human values and aspirations. Researchers \\nand practitioners have increased their attention to these challenges, and should continue to focus on them.  \\nDeveloping and studying machine intelligence can help us better understand and appreciate our human \\nintelligence. Used thoughtfully, AI can augment our intelligence, helping us chart a better and wiser path \\nforward. '),\n",

Social justice and \\npublic policy institutions that do not typically engage with advanced technologies and data science in \\ntheir work should consider partnerships with AI researchers and practitioners that can help apply AI \\ntactics to the broad social problems these institutions already address in other ways. \\n \\nRecommendation 2: Federal agencies should prioritize open training data and open data standards in \\nAI. The government should emphasize the release of datasets that enable the use of AI to address social \\nchallenges. Potential steps may include developing an “Open Data for AI” initiative with the objective of \\nreleasing a significant number of government data sets to accelerate AI research and galvanize the use of \\nopen data standards and best practices across government, academia, and the private sector. \\n \\nRecommendation 3: The Federal Government should explore ways to improve the capacity of key \\nagencies to apply AI to their missions. For example, Federal agencies should explore the potential to \\ncreate DARPA-like organizations to support high-risk, high-reward AI research and its application, much \\nas the Department of Education has done through its proposal to create an “ARPA-ED,” to support R&D \\nto determine whether AI and other technologies could significantly improve student learning outcomes. \\n \\nRecommendation 4: The NSTC MLAI subcommittee should develop a community of practice for AI \\npractitioners across government.  Agencies should work together to develop and share standards and \\nbest practices around the use of AI in government operations. Agencies should ensure that Federal \\nemployee training programs include relevant AI opportunities.  \\n \\nRecommendation 5: Agencies should draw on appropriate technical expertise at the senior level when \\nsetting regulatory policy for AI-enabled products. Effective regulation of AI-enabled products requires \\ncollaboration between agency leadership, staff knowledgeable about the existing regulatory framework \\nand regulatory practices generally, and technical experts with knowledge of AI. Agency leadership should \\ntake steps to recruit the necessary technical talent, or identify it in existing agency staff, and should \\nensure that there are sufficient technical “seats at the table” in regulatory policy discussions.  \\n \\nRecommendation 6: Agencies should use the full range of personnel assignment and exchange models \\n(e.g. hiring authorities) to foster a Federal workforce with more diverse perspectives on the current \\nstate of technology.  \\n \\nRecommendation 7: The Department of Transportation should work with industry and researchers on \\nways to increase sharing of data for safety, research, and other purposes. The future roles of AI in \\nsurface and air transportation are undeniable. Accordingly, Federal actors should focus in the near-term \\non developing increasingly rich sets of data, consistent with consumer privacy, that can better inform \\npolicy-making as these technologies mature. \\n '),\n",

The Subcommittee should update the list of milestones \\nas knowledge advances and the consensus of experts changes over time. The Subcommittee should \\nconsider reporting to the public on AI developments, when appropriate. \\n \\nRecommendation 11: The Government should monitor the state of AI in other countries, especially \\nwith respect to milestones.  \\n \\nRecommendation 12: Industry should work with government to keep government updated on the \\ngeneral progress of AI in industry, including the likelihood of milestones being reached soon.  \\n \\nRecommendation 13: The Federal government should prioritize basic and long-term AI research. The \\nNation as a whole would benefit from a steady increase in Federal and private-sector AI R&D, with a \\nparticular emphasis on basic research and long-term, high-risk research initiatives. Because basic and \\nlong-term research especially are areas where the private sector is not likely to invest, Federal \\ninvestments will be important for R&D in these areas. \\n \\nRecommendation 14: The NSTC Subcommittees on MLAI and NITRD, in conjunction with the NSTC \\nCommittee on Science, Technology, Engineering, and Education (CoSTEM),, should initiate a study \\non the AI workforce pipeline in order to develop actions that ensure an appropriate increase in the size, \\nquality, and diversity of the workforce, including AI researchers, specialists, and users. \\n \\nRecommendation 15: The Executive Office of the President should publish a follow-on report by the \\nend of this year, to further investigate the effects of AI and automation on the U.S. job market, and \\noutline recommended policy responses.  \\n \\nRecommendation 16: Federal agencies that use AI-based systems to make or provide decision support \\nfor consequential decisions about individuals should take extra care to ensure the efficacy and fairness \\nof those systems, based on evidence-based verification and validation.  \\n \\nRecommendation 17: Federal agencies that make grants to state and local governments in support of \\nthe use of AI-based systems to make consequential decisions about individuals should review the terms \\nof grants to ensure that AI-based products or services purchased with Federal grant funds produce \\nresults in a sufficiently transparent fashion and are supported by evidence of efficacy and fairness. \\n '),\n",

Code-driven systems have spread to more than half of the world’s inhabitants in ambient information and connectivity, offering previously unimagined opportunities and unprecedented threats. As emerging algorithm-driven artificial intelligence (AI) continues to spread, will people be better off than they are today?  Some 979 technology pioneers, innovators, developers, business and policy leaders, researchers and activists answered this question in a canvassing of experts conducted in the summer of 2018.  The experts predicted networked artificial intelligence will amplify human effectiveness but also threaten human autonomy, agency and capabilities. They spoke of the wide-ranging possibilities; that computers might match or even exceed human intelligence and capabilities on tasks such as complex decision-making, reasoning and learning, sophisticated analytics and pattern recognition, visual acuity, speech recognition and language translation. They said “smart” systems in communities, in vehicles, in buildings and utilities, on farms and in business processes will save time, money and lives and offer opportunities for individuals to enjoy a more-customized future. Many focused their optimistic remarks on health care and the many possible applications of AI in diagnosing and treating patients or helping senior citizens live fuller and healthier lives. They were also enthusiastic about AI’s role in contributing to broad public-health programs built around massive amounts of data that may be captured in the coming years about everything from personal genomes to nutrition. Additionally, a number of these experts predicted that AI would abet long-anticipated changes in formal and informal education systems. Yet, most experts, regardless of whether they are optimistic or not, expressed concerns about the long-term impact of these new tools on the essential elements of being human. All respondents in this non-scientific canvassing were asked to elaborate on why they felt AI would leave people better off or not. Many shared deep worries, and many also suggested pathways toward solutions. The main themes they sounded about threats and remedies are outlined in the accompanying table. '),\n",

People lack input and do not learn the context about how the tools work. They sacrifice independence, privacy and power over choice; they have no control over these processes. This effect will deepen as automated systems become more prevalent and complex.  Data abuse:  Data use and surveillance in complex systems is designed for profit or for exercising power  \\nMost AI tools are and will be in the hands of companies striving for profits or governments striving for power. Values and ethics are often not baked into the digital systems making people’s decisions for them. These systems are globally networked and not easy to regulate or rein in.  Job loss: The AI takeover of jobs will widen economic divides, leading to social upheaval The efficiencies and other economic advantages of code-based machine intelligence will continue to disrupt all aspects of human work. While some expect new jobs will emerge, others worry about massive job losses, widening economic divides and social upheavals, including populist uprisings.  Dependence lock-in: Reduction of individuals’ cognitive, social and survival skills \\nMany see AI as augmenting human capacities but some predict the opposite – that people’s deepening dependence on machine-driven networks will erode their abilities to think for themselves, take action independent of automated systems and interact effectively with others.  Mayhem: Autonomous weapons, cybercrime and weaponized information \\nSome predict further erosion of traditional sociopolitical structures and the possibility of great loss of lives due to accelerated growth of autonomous military applications and the use of weaponized information, lies and propaganda to dangerously destabilize human groups. Some also fear cybercriminals’ reach into economic systems.       SUGGESTED SOLUTIONS Global good is No. 1: Improve human collaboration across borders and  stakeholder groups  \\nDigital cooperation to serve humanity’s best interests is the top priority. Ways must be found for people around the world to come to common understandings and agreements – to join forces to facilitate the innovation of widely accepted approaches aimed at tackling wicked problems and maintaining control over complex human-digital networks.  Values-based system:  Develop policies to assure AI will be directed at ‘humanness’ and common good  \\nAdopt a ‘moonshot mentality’ to build inclusive, decentralized intelligent digital networks ‘imbued with empathy’ that help humans aggressively ensure that technology meets social and ethical responsibilities. Some new level of regulatory and certification process will be necessary.  Prioritize people:  Alter economic and political systems to better help humans ‘race with the robots’  \\nReorganize economic and political systems toward the goal of expanding humans’ capacities and capabilities in order to heighten human/AI collaboration and staunch trends that would compromise human relevance in the face of programmed intelligence. PEW RESEARCH CENTER and ELON UNIVERSITY’S IMAGINING THE INTERNET CENTER                                                   December 2018                        '),\n",

Analysts expect that people will become even more dependent on networked artificial intelligence (AI) in complex digital systems. Some say we will continue on the historic arc of augmenting our lives with mostly positive results as we widely implement these networked tools. Some say our increasing dependence on these AI and related systems is likely to lead to widespread difficulties.  Our question: By 2030, do you think it is most likely that advancing AI and related technology systems will enhance human capacities and empower them? That is, most of the time, will most people be better off than they are today? Or is it most likely that advancing AI and related technology systems will lessen human autonomy and agency to such an extent that most people will not be better off than the way things are today?” Overall, and despite the downsides they fear, 63% of respondents in this canvassing said they are hopeful that most individuals will be mostly better off in 2030, and 37% said people will not be better off. A number of the thought leaders who participated in this canvassing said humans’ expanding reliance on technological systems will only go well if close attention is paid to how these tools, platforms and networks are engineered, distributed and updated. Some of the powerful, overarching answers included those from:  Sonia Katyal, co-director of the Berkeley Center for Law and Technology and a member of the inaugural U.S. Commerce Department Digital Economy Board of Advisors, predicted, “In 2030, the greatest set of questions will involve how perceptions of AI and their application will influence the trajectory of civil rights in the future. Questions about privacy, speech, the right of assembly and technological construction of personhood will all re-emerge in this new AI context, throwing into question our deepest-held beliefs about equality and opportunity for all. Who will benefit and who will be disadvantaged in this new world depends on how broadly we analyze these questions today, for the future.” Erik Brynjolfsson, director of the MIT Initiative on the Digital Economy and author of “Machine, Platform, Crowd: Harnessing Our Digital Future,” said, “AI and related technologies have already achieved superhuman performance in many areas, and there is little doubt that their '),\n",

For instance, we can virtually eliminate global poverty, massively reduce disease and provide better education to almost everyone on the planet. That said, AI and ML [machine learning] can also be used to increasingly concentrate wealth and power, leaving many people behind, and to create even more horrifying weapons. Neither outcome is inevitable, so the right question is not ‘What will happen?’ but ‘What will we choose to do?’ We need to work aggressively to make sure technology matches our values. This can and must be done at all levels, from government, to business, to academia, and to individual choices.”  Bryan Johnson, founder and CEO of Kernel, a leading developer of advanced neural interfaces, and OS Fund, a venture capital firm, said, “I strongly believe the answer depends on whether we can shift our economic systems toward prioritizing radical human improvement and staunching the trend toward human irrelevance in the face of AI. I don’t mean just jobs; I mean true, existential irrelevance, which is the end result of not prioritizing human well-being and cognition.”  Marina Gorbis, executive director of the Institute for the Future, said, “Without significant changes in our political economy and data governance regimes [AI] is likely to create greater economic inequalities, more surveillance and more programmed and non-human-centric interactions. Every time we program our environments, we end up programming ourselves and our interactions. Humans have to become more standardized, removing serendipity and ambiguity from our interactions. And this ambiguity and complexity is what is the essence of being human.” Judith Donath, author of “The Social Machine, Designs for Living Online” and faculty fellow at Harvard University's Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society, commented, “By 2030, most social situations will be facilitated by bots – intelligent-seeming programs that interact with us in human-like ways. At home, parents will engage skilled bots to help kids with homework and catalyze dinner conversations. At work, bots will run meetings. A bot confidant will be considered essential for psychological well-being, and we’ll increasingly turn to such companions for advice ranging from what to wear to whom to marry. We humans care deeply about how others see us – and the others whose approval we seek will increasingly be artificial. By then, the difference between humans and bots will have blurred considerably. Via screen and projection, the voice, appearance and behaviors of bots will be indistinguishable from those of humans, and even physical robots, though obviously non-human, will be so convincingly sincere that our impression of them as thinking, feeling beings, on par with or superior to ourselves, will be unshaken. Adding to the ambiguity, our own communication will be heavily augmented: Programs will compose many of our messages and our online/AR appearance will [be] computationally crafted. (Raw, unaided human speech and demeanor will seem embarrassingly clunky, slow and \"),\n",

Aided by their access to vast troves of data about each of us, bots will far surpass humans in their ability to attract and persuade us. Able to mimic emotion expertly, they’ll never be overcome by feelings: If they blurt something out in anger, it will be because that behavior was calculated to be the most efficacious way of advancing whatever goals they had ‘in mind.’ But what are those goals? Artificially intelligent companions will cultivate the impression that social goals similar to our own motivate them – to be held in good regard, whether as a beloved friend, an admired boss, etc. But their real collaboration will be with the humans and institutions that control them. Like their forebears today, these will be sellers of goods who employ them to stimulate consumption and politicians who commission them to sway opinions.” Andrew McLaughlin, executive director of the Center for Innovative Thinking at Yale University, previously deputy chief technology officer of the United States for President Barack Obama and global public policy lead for Google, wrote, “2030 is not far in the future. My sense is that innovations like the internet and networked AI have massive short-term benefits, along with long-term negatives that can take decades to be recognizable. AI will drive a vast range of efficiency optimizations but also enable hidden discrimination and arbitrary penalization of individuals in areas like insurance, job seeking and performance assessment.” Michael M. Roberts, first president and CEO of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) and Internet Hall of Fame member, wrote, “The range of opportunities for intelligent agents to augment human intelligence is still virtually unlimited. The major issue is that the more convenient an agent is, the more it needs to know about you – preferences, timing, capacities, etc. – which creates a tradeoff of more help requires more intrusion. This is not a black-and-white issue – the shades of gray and associated remedies will be argued endlessly. The record to date is that convenience overwhelms privacy. I suspect that will continue.” danah boyd, a principal researcher for Microsoft and founder and president of the Data & Society Research Institute, said, “AI is a tool that will be used by humans for all sorts of purposes, including in the pursuit of power. There will be abuses of power that involve AI, just as there will be advances in science and humanitarian efforts that also involve AI. Unfortunately, there are certain trend lines that are likely to create massive instability. Take, for example, climate change and climate migration. This will further destabilize Europe and the U.S., and I expect that, in panic, we will see AI be used in harmful ways in light of other geopolitical crises.” Amy Webb, founder of the Future Today Institute and professor of strategic foresight at New York University, commented, “The social safety net structures currently in place in the U.S. and in many other countries around the world weren’t designed for our transition to AI. The transition through AI will last the next 50 years or more. As we move farther into this third era of computing, '),\n",
              " Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/ai and the future of humans.pdf', 'page': 7}, page_content='7 PEW RESEARCH CENTER \\nwww.pewresearch.org \\nand as every single industry becomes more deeply entrenched with AI systems, we will need new hybrid-skilled knowledge workers who can operate in jobs that have never needed to exist before. We’ll need farmers who know how to work with big data sets. Oncologists trained as robotocists. Biologists trained as electrical engineers. We won’t need to prepare our workforce just once, with a few changes to the curriculum. As AI matures, we will need a responsive workforce, capable of adapting to new processes, systems and tools every few years. The need for these fields will arise faster than our labor departments, schools and universities are acknowledging. It’s easy to look back on history through the lens of present – and to overlook the social unrest caused by widespread technological unemployment. We need to address a difficult truth that few are willing to utter aloud: AI will eventually cause a large number of people to be permanently out of work. Just as generations before witnessed sweeping changes during and in the aftermath of the Industrial Revolution, the rapid pace of technology will likely mean that Baby Boomers and the oldest members of Gen X – especially those whose jobs can be replicated by robots – won’t be able to retrain for other kinds of work without a significant investment of time and effort.” Barry Chudakov, founder and principal of Sertain Research, commented, “By 2030 the human-machine/AI collaboration will be a necessary tool to manage and counter the effects of multiple simultaneous accelerations: broad technology advancement, globalization, climate change and attendant global migrations. In the past, human societies managed change through gut and intuition, but as Eric Teller, CEO of Google X, has said, ‘Our societal structures are failing to keep pace with the rate of change.’ To keep pace with that change and to manage a growing list of ‘wicked problems’ by 2030, AI – or using Joi Ito’s phrase, extended intelligence – will value and revalue virtually every area of human behavior and interaction. AI and advancing technologies will change our response framework and time frames (which in turn, changes our sense of time). Where once social interaction happened in places – work, school, church, family environments – social interactions will increasingly happen in continuous, simultaneous time. If we are fortunate, we will follow the 23 Asilomar AI Principles outlined by the Future of Life Institute and will work toward ‘not undirected intelligence but beneficial intelligence.’ Akin to nuclear deterrence stemming from mutually assured destruction, AI and related technology systems constitute a force for a moral renaissance. We must embrace that moral renaissance, or we will face moral conundrums that could bring about human demise. ... My greatest hope for human-machine/AI collaboration constitutes a moral and ethical renaissance – we adopt a moonshot mentality and lock arms to prepare for the accelerations coming at us. My greatest fear is that we adopt the logic of our emerging technologies – instant response, isolation behind screens, endless comparison of self-worth, fake self-presentation – without thinking or responding smartly.” John C. Havens, executive director of the IEEE Global Initiative on Ethics of Autonomous and Intelligent Systems and the Council on Extended Intelligence, wrote, “Now, in 2018, a majority of '),\n",

Soon it will be extremely difficult to identify any autonomous or intelligent systems whose algorithms don’t interact with human data in one form or another.” Batya Friedman, a human-computer interaction professor at the University of Washington’s Information School, wrote, “Our scientific and technological capacities have and will continue to far surpass our moral ones – that is our ability to use wisely and humanely the knowledge and tools that we develop. ... Automated warfare – when autonomous weapons kill human beings without human engagement – can lead to a lack of responsibility for taking the enemy’s life or even knowledge that an enemy’s life has been taken. At stake is nothing less than what sort of society we want to live in and how we experience our humanity.” Greg Shannon, chief scientist for the CERT Division at Carnegie Mellon University, said, “Better/worse will appear 4:1 with the long-term ratio 2:1. AI will do well for repetitive work where ‘close’ will be good enough and humans dislike the work. … Life will definitely be better as AI extends lifetimes, from health apps that intelligently ‘nudge’ us to health, to warnings about impending heart/stroke events, to automated health care for the underserved (remote) and those who need extended care (elder care). As to liberty, there are clear risks. AI affects agency by creating entities with meaningful intellectual capabilities for monitoring, enforcing and even punishing individuals. Those who know how to use it will have immense potential power over those who don’t/can’t. Future happiness is really unclear. Some will cede their agency to AI in games, work and community, much like the opioid crisis steals agency today. On the other hand, many will be freed from mundane, unengaging tasks/jobs. If elements of community happiness are part of AI objective functions, then AI could catalyze an explosion of happiness.” Kostas Alexandridis, author of “Exploring Complex Dynamics in Multi-agent-based Intelligent Systems,” predicted, “Many of our day-to-day decisions will be automated with minimal intervention by the end-user. Autonomy and/or independence will be sacrificed and replaced by convenience. Newer generations of citizens will become more and more dependent on networked AI structures and processes. There are challenges that need to be addressed in terms of critical thinking and heterogeneity. Networked interdependence will, more likely than not, increase our vulnerability to cyberattacks. There is also a real likelihood that there will exist sharper divisions between digital ‘haves’ and ‘have-nots,’ as well as among technologically dependent digital infrastructures. Finally, there is the question of the new ‘commanding heights’ of the digital network infrastructure’s ownership and control.”  '),\n",
              " Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/ai and the future of humans.pdf', 'page': 9}, page_content=\"9 PEW RESEARCH CENTER \\nwww.pewresearch.org \\nOscar Gandy, emeritus professor of communication at the University of Pennsylvania, responded, “We already face an ungranted assumption when we are asked to imagine human-machine ‘collaboration.’ Interaction is a bit different, but still tainted by the grant of a form of identity – maybe even personhood – to machines that we will use to make our way through all sorts of opportunities and challenges. The problems we will face in the future are quite similar to the problems we currently face when we rely upon ‘others’ (including technological systems, devices and networks) to acquire things we value and avoid those other things (that we might, or might not be aware of).” James Scofield O'Rourke, a professor of management at the University of Notre Dame, said, “Technology has, throughout recorded history, been a largely neutral concept. The question of its value has always been dependent on its application. For what purpose will AI and other technological advances be used? Everything from gunpowder to internal combustion engines to nuclear fission has been applied in both helpful and destructive ways. Assuming we can contain or control AI (and not the other way around), the answer to whether we’ll be better off depends entirely on us (or our progeny). ‘The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves, that we are underlings.’” Simon Biggs, a professor of interdisciplinary arts at the University of Edinburgh, said, “AI will function to augment human capabilities. The problem is not with AI but with humans. As a species we are aggressive, competitive and lazy. We are also empathic, community minded and (sometimes) self-sacrificing. We have many other attributes. These will all be amplified. Given historical precedent, one would have to assume it will be our worst qualities that are augmented. My expectation is that in 2030 AI will be in routine use to fight wars and kill people, far more effectively than we can currently kill. As societies we will be less affected by this as we currently are, as we will not be doing the fighting and killing ourselves. Our capacity to modify our behaviour, subject to empathy and an associated ethical framework, will be reduced by the disassociation between our agency and the act of killing. We cannot expect our AI systems to be ethical on our behalf – they won’t be, as they will be designed to kill efficiently, not thoughtfully. My other primary concern is to do with surveillance and control. The advent of China’s Social Credit System (SCS) is an indicator of what it likely to come. We will exist within an SCS as AI constructs hybrid instances of ourselves that may or may not resemble who we are. But our rights and affordances as individuals will be determined by the SCS. This is the Orwellian nightmare realised.” Mark Surman, executive director of the Mozilla Foundation, responded, “AI will continue to concentrate power and wealth in the hands of a few big monopolies based on the U.S. and China. Most people – and parts of the world – will be worse off.”  \"),\n",

The public is reduced to a collective of consumers awaiting the next technology. Whose notion of ‘progress’ will prevail? We have ample evidence of AI being used to drive profits, regardless of implications for long-held values; to enhance governmental control and even score citizens’ ‘social credit’ without input from citizens themselves. Like technologies before it, AI is agnostic. Its deployment rests in the hands of society. But absent an AI-literate public, the decision of how best to deploy AI will fall to special interests. Will this mean equitable deployment, the amelioration of social injustice and AI in the public service? Because the answer to this question is social rather than technological, I’m pessimistic. The fix? We need to develop an AI-literate public, which means focused attention in the educational sector and in public-facing media. We need to assure diversity in the development of AI technologies. And until the public, its elected representatives and their legal and regulatory regimes can get up to speed with these fast-moving developments we need to exercise caution and oversight in AI’s development.” The remainder of this report is divided into three sections that draw from hundreds of additional respondents’ hopeful and critical observations: 1) concerns about human-AI evolution, 2) suggested solutions to address AI’s impact, and 3) expectations of what life will be like in 2030, including respondents’ positive outlooks on the quality of life and the future of work, health care and education.

Concerns about human agency, evolution and survival A clear majority of the responses from these experts contained material outlining certain challenges, fears or concerns about the AI-infused future. The five most-often mentioned concerns were: 1) the use of AI reduces individuals’ control over their lives; 2) surveillance and data systems designed primarily for efficiency, profit and control are inherently dangerous;3) displacement of human jobs by AI will widen economic and digital divides, possibly leading to social upheaval; 4) individuals’ cognitive, social and survival skills will be diminished as they become dependent on AI; and 5) citizens will face increased vulnerabilities, such as exposure to cybercrime and cyberwarfare that spin out of control and the possibility that essential organizations are endangered by weaponized information. A few also worried about the wholesale destruction of humanity. The sections of this chapter will cover experts’ answers tied to these themes. The use of AI reduces individuals’ control over their lives  Autonomous systems can reduce or eliminate the need for human involvement in some tasks. Today’s ever-advancing artificial narrow intelligence (ANI) tools – for instance, search engines and digital “agents” such as Siri, Alexa and Cortana – are not close to reaching the goal of human-like artificial general intelligence (AGI). They are, however, continually becoming more powerful thanks to developments in machine learning and natural language processing and advances in materials science, networking, energy-storage and hardware capabilities. ANI is machine intelligence that equals or exceeds people’s abilities or efficiency at a specific task. For years, code-based tools in robots and other systems have performed repetitive tasks like factory-floor assembly activities. Today, these tools are quickly evolving to master human traits such as reason, logic, learning, task-performance and creativity. Today’s smart, networked,  software-equipped devices, cars, digital assistants and platforms, such as Google search and Facebook social mapping, accomplish extremely complex tasks. The systems underpinning today’s global financial markets, businesses, militaries, police forces, and medical, energy and industrial operations are all dependent upon networked AI of one type or another. What is the future of humans in an age of accelerating technological change?  Many experts in this canvassing said that as AI advances human autonomy and agency are at risk. They note that decision-making on key aspects of life is ceded to code-driven tools. Individuals who function in this digital world sacrifice, to varying degrees, their independence, right to privacy and power over choice. Many of the experts who worry about this say humans accede to this in order to stay competitive, to participate socially and professionally in the world, to be entertained '),\n",

They say people hand over some control of their lives because of the perceived advantages they gain via digital tools – efficiency, convenience and superior pattern recognition, data storage, and search-and-find capabilities. Here is a selection of responses from these experts that touch on this:  An anonymous respondent summed up the concerns of many, writing, “The most-feared reversal in human fortune of the AI age is loss of agency. The trade-off for the near-instant, low-friction convenience of digital life is the loss of context about and control over its processes. People’s blind dependence on digital tools is deepening as automated systems become more complex and ownership of those systems is by the elite.” Baratunde Thurston, futurist, former director of digital at The Onion and co-founder of comedy/technology start-up Cultivated Wit, said, “For the record, this is not the future I want, but it is what I expect given existing default settings in our economic and sociopolitical system preferences. … The problems to which we are applying machine learning and AI are generally not ones that will lead to a ‘better’ life for most people. That’s why I say in 2030, most people won’t be better due to AI. We won’t be more autonomous; we will be more automated as we follow the metaphorical GPS line through daily interactions. We don’t choose our breakfast or our morning workouts or our route to work. An algorithm will make these choices for us in a way that maximizes efficiency (narrowly defined) and probably also maximizes the profitability of the service provider. By 2030, we may cram more activities and interactions into our days, but I don’t think that will make our lives ‘better.’ A better life, by my definition, is one in which we feel more valued and happy. Given that the biggest investments in AI are on behalf of marketing efforts designed to deplete our attention and bank balances, I can only imagine this leading to days that are more filled but lives that are less fulfilled. To create a different future, I believe we must unleash these technologies toward goals beyond profit maximization. Imagine a mapping app that plotted your work commute through the most beautiful route, not simply the fastest. Imagine a communications app that facilitated deeper connections with people you deemed most important. These technologies must be more people-centric. We need to ask that they ask us, ‘What is important to you? How would you like to spend your time?’ But that’s not the system we’re building. All those decisions have been hoarded by the unimaginative pursuit of profit.” Thad Hall, a researcher and coauthor of “Politics for a Connected American Public,” added: “AI is likely to have benefits – from improving medical diagnoses to improving people’s consumer experiences. However, there are four aspects of AI that are very problematic. 1) It is likely to result in more economic uncertainty and dislocation for people, including employment issues and more need to change jobs to stay relevant. 2) AI will continue to erode people’s privacy as search becomes more thorough. China’s monitoring of populations illustrates what this could look like in '),\n",

Given that algorithms often have identifiable biases (e.g., favoring people who are white or male), they likely also have biases that are less well-recognized, such as biases that are negative toward people with disabilities, older people or other groups. These biases may ripple through society in unknown ways. Some groups are more likely to be monitored effectively. 4) AI is creating a world where reality can be manipulated in ways we do not appreciate. Fake videos, audio and similar media are likely to explode and create a world where ‘reality’ is hard to discern. The relativistic political world will become more so, with people having evidence to support their own reality or multiple realities that mean no one knows what is the ‘truth.’” Thomas Schneider, head of International Relations Service and vice-director at the Federal Office of Communications (OFCOM) in Switzerland, said, “AI will help mankind to be more efficient, live safer and healthier, and manage resources like energy, transport, etc., more efficiently. At the same time, there are a number of risks that AI may be used by those in power to manipulate, control and dominate others. (We have seen this with every new technology: It can and will be used for good and bad.) Much will depend about how AI will be governed: If we have an inclusive and bottom-up governance system of well-informed citizens, then AI will be used for improving our quality of life. If only a few people decide about how AI is used and what for, many others will be dependent on the decisions of these few and risk being manipulated by them. The biggest danger in my view is that there will be a greater pressure on all members of our societies to live according to what ‘the system’ will tell us is ‘best for us’ to do and not to do, i.e., that we may lose the autonomy to decide ourselves how we want to live our lives, to choose diverse ways of doing things. With more and more ‘recommendations,’ ‘rankings’ and competition through social pressure and control, we may risk a loss of individual fundamental freedoms (including but not limited to the right to a private life) that we have fought for in the last decades and centuries.”  Bart Knijnenburg, assistant professor of computer science who is active in the Human Factors Institute at Clemson University, said, “Whether AI will make our lives better depends on how it is implemented. Many current AI systems (including adaptive content-presentation systems and so-called recommender systems) try to avoid information and choice overload by replacing our decision-making processes with algorithmic predictions. True empowerment will come from these systems supporting rather than replacing our decision-making practices. This is the only way we can overcome choice/information overload and at the same time avoid so-called ‘filter bubbles.’ For example, Facebook’s current post ranking systems will eventually turn us all into cat video watching zombies, because they follow our behavioral patterns, which may not be aligned with our preferences. The algorithms behind these tools need to support human agency, not replace it.” '),\n",

Whether people will be better off than they are today is a separate question, and the answer depends to a substantial degree on how looming technological developments unfold. On the one hand, if corporate entities retain unbridled control over how AI-driven algorithms interact with humans, people will be less well off, as the loss of autonomy and agency will be largely to the benefit of the corporations. On the other hand, if ‘we the people’ demand that corporate entities deploy AI-algorithms in a manner that is sensitive to the issues of human autonomy and agency, then there is a real possibility for us to be better off – enhanced by the power of the AI-driven algorithm and yet not relegated to an impoverished seat at the decision-making table. One could even parse this further, anticipating that certain decisions can be comfortably left in the hands of the AI-driven algorithm, with other decisions either falling back on humans or arrived at through a combination of AI-driven algorithmic input and human decision making. If we approach these issues skillfully – and it will take quite a bit of collaborative work between ethicists and industry – we can have the best of both worlds. On the other hand, if we are lax in acting as watchdogs over industry we will be functionally rich and decisionally poor.” Paul Vixie, an Internet Hall of Fame member known for designing and implementing several Domain Name System protocol extensions and applications, wrote, “Understanding is a perfect proxy for control. As we make more of the world’s economy non-understandable by the masses, we make it easier for powerful interests to practice control. Real autonomy or privacy or unpredictability will be seen as a threat and managed around.” João Pedro Taveira, embedded systems researcher and smart grids architect for INOV INESC Inovação in Portugal, wrote, “Basically, we will lose several degrees of freedom. Are we ready for that? When we wake up to what is happening it might be too late to do anything about it. Artificial intelligence is a subject that must be studied philosophically, in open-minded, abstract and hypothetical ways. Using this perspective, the issues to be solved by humans are (but not limited to) AI, feelings, values, motivation, free will, solidarity, love and hate. Yes, we will have serious problems. Dropping the ‘artificial’ off AI, look at the concept of intelligence. As a computer-science person, I know that so-called ‘AI’ studies how an agent (a software program) increases its knowledge base using rules that are defined using pattern-recognition mechanisms. No matter which mechanisms are used to generate this rule set, the result will be always behavioral profiling. Right now, everybody uses and agrees to use a wide set of appliances, services and products without a full understanding of the information that is being shared with enterprises, companies and other parties. There’s a lack of needed regulation and audit mechanisms on who or what uses our information and how it is used and whether it is stored for future use. Governments and others '),\n",

Enterprises and companies might argue that these tools offer improvement of quality of service, but there’s no guarantee about individuals’ privacy, anonymity, individual security, intractability and so on.” Ramon Lopez de Mantaras, director of the Spanish National Research Council’s Artificial Intelligence Research Institute, said, “I do not think it is a good idea to give high levels of autonomy to AI systems. They are, and will be, weak AI systems without commonsense knowledge. They will have more and more competence, yes, but this will be competence without comprehension. AI machines should remain at the level of tools or, at most, assistants, always keeping the human in the loop. We should all read or re-read the book ‘Computer Power and Human Reason’ by Joseph Weizenbaum before deciding whether or not to give lots of autonomy to stupid machines.” Oscar Gandy, emeritus professor of communication at the University of Pennsylvania, responded, “AI systems will make quite substantial and important contributions to the ability of health care providers to generate accurate diagnoses of maladies and threats to my well-being, now and in the future. I can imagine the development and deployment of systems in which my well-being is the primary basis of our relationship. I am less sure about how my access to and use of this resource may be constrained or distorted by the interests of the other actors (humans within profit/power-seeking orientations). I assume that they will be aided by their own AI systems informing them how to best present options to me. I am hopeful that we will have agents (whether private, social, governmental) whose interest and responsibility is in ensuring that my interests govern those relationships.” Robert Epstein, senior research psychologist at the American Institute for Behavioral Research and Technology and the founding director of the Loebner Prize, a competition in artificial intelligence, said, “By 2030, it is likely that AIs will have achieved a type of sentience, even if it is not human-like. They will also be able to exercise varying degrees of control over most human communications, financial transactions, transportation systems, power grids and weapon systems. As I noted in my 2008 book, ‘Parsing the Turing Test,’ they will reside in the ‘InterNest’ we have been building for them, and we will have no way of dislodging them. How they decide to deal with humanity – to help us, ignore us or destroy us – will be entirely up to them, and there is no way currently to predict which avenue they will choose. Because a few paranoid humans will almost certainly try to destroy the new sentient AIs, there is at least a reasonable possibility that that they will swat us like the flies we are – the possibility that Stephen Hawking, Elon Musk and others have warned about. There is no way, to my knowledge, of stopping this future from emerging. Driven by the convenience of connectivity, the greed that underlies business expansion and the '),\n",

We’ve seen a widening gap between the very rich and everybody else. That is likely bad for democracy. AI seems likely to make the employment/training problem worse in the U.S., and AI may have similar effects in countries that currently provide cheap labor. On the political-governmental side, AI will exacerbate current surveillance and accountability problems. I figure that AI will improve and speed up all biometric pattern recognition as well as DNA analysis and natural language processing. And though we know that much of this is biased, we’re not adequately counteracting the bias we know about. The companies who generate and disseminate AI technology have every incentive to continue. I’m not optimistic that collective action – at least in the U.S. system – will successfully counter those incentives.” Brian Behlendorf, executive director of the Hyperledger project at The Linux Foundation and expert in blockchain technology, wrote, “I am concerned that AI will not be a democratizing power, but will enhance further the power and wealth of those who already hold it. This is because more data means better AI, and data is expensive to acquire, especially personal data, the most valuable kind. This is in contrast to networking technologies, whose benefits were shared fairly widely as the prices for components came down equally fast for everyone. One other reason: AI apps will be harder to debug than ordinary apps, and we already see hard-to-debug applications leading to disenfranchisement and deterioration of living. So, I do not take as a given that AI will enrich ‘most’ people's lives over the next 12 years.” Eileen Donahoe, executive director of the Global Digital Policy Incubator at Stanford University, commented, “While I do believe human-machines collaboration will bring many benefits to society over time, I fear that we will not have made enough progress by 2030 to ensure that benefits will be spread evenly or to protect against downside risks, especially as they relate to bias, discrimination and loss of accountability by that time.” David Bray, executive director of People-Centered Internet, commented, “Hope: Human-machine/AI collaborations extend our abilities of humans while we (humans) intentionally strive to preserve values of respect, dignity and agency of choice for individuals. Machines bring together different groups of people and communities and help us work and live together by reflecting on our own biases and helping us come to understand the plurality of different perspectives of others.

Machines amplify existing confirmation biases and other human characteristics resulting in sensationalist, emotion-ridden news and other communications that gets page views and ad-clicks yet lack nuance of understanding, resulting in tribalism and a devolution of open societies and pluralities to the detriment of the global human condition.” Bernie Hogan, senior research fellow at Oxford Internet Institute, wrote, “The current political and economic climate suggests that existing technology, especially machine learning, will be used to create better decisions for those in power while creating an ever more tedious morass of bureaucracy for the rest. We see little example of successful bottom-up technology, open source technology and hacktivism relative to the encroaching surveillance state and attention economy.” Dan Buehrer, a retired professor of computer science formerly with the National Chung Cheng University in Taiwan, warned, “Statistics will be replaced by individualized models, thus allowing control of all individuals by totalitarian states and, eventually, by socially intelligent machines.”  Nathalie Marechal, doctoral candidate at the University of Southern California’s Annenberg School for Communication who researches the intersection of internet policy and human rights, said, “Absent rapid and decisive actions to rein in both government overreach and companies’ amoral quest for profit, technological developments – including AI – will bring about the infrastructure for total social control, threatening democracy and the right to individual self-determination.” Katja Grace, contributor to the AI Impacts research project and a research associate with the Machine Intelligence Research Institute, said, “There is a substantial chance that AI will leave everyone worse off, perhaps radically so. The chance is less than 50 percent, but the downside risk is so large that there could be an expectation the world might be worse for AI.” David A. Banks, an associate research analyst with the Social Science Research Council, said, “AI will be very useful to a small professional class but will be used to monitor and control everyone else.”  Luis German Rodriguez Leal, teacher and researcher at the Universidad Central de Venezuela and consultant on technology for development, said, “Humankind is not addressing properly the issue of educating people about possibilities and risks of human-machine/AI collaboration.

This fact has a meaningful impact on our social, political, economic and private life. We are not doing enough to attend to this issue, and it is getting very late.” Llewellyn Kriel, CEO of TopEditor International, a media services company based in Johannesburg, South Africa, wrote, “Current developments do not augur well for the fair growth of AI. Vast swaths of the population simply do not have the intellectual capacity or level of sophistication to understand 1) the technology itself and 2) the implications of its safe use. This entrenches and widens the digital divide in places like Africa. The socio-political implications of this breed deep primitive superstition, racial hatred toward whites and Asians who are seen as techno-colonialists and the growth of kleptocracies amid the current mushrooming of corruption.”  Steven Thompson, an author specializing in illuminating emerging issues and editor of “Androids, Cyborgs, and Robots in Contemporary Culture and Society,” wrote, “The keyword from the query is ‘dependence.’ I published pioneering quantitative research on internet addiction and dependency in 1996, and followed up 15 years later with a related, updated research talk on the future of AI and internet dependency at a UNESCO-sponsored conference on information literacy in Morocco. My expertise is in ethical and technological issues related to moving the internet appliance into the human body. … The internet is moving into the human body, and, in that process, societal statuses are altered, privileging some while abandoning others in the name of emerging technologies, and the global order is restructuring to the same effect. Think of net neutrality issues gone wild, corporately and humanly sustained with the privileges such creation and maintenance affords some members of society. Now think of the liberty issues arising from those persons who are digital outcasts, and wish to not be on the grid, yet will be forced to do so by society and even government edicts.” Alan Mutter, a longtime Silicon Valley CEO, cable TV executive and now a teacher of media economics and entrepreneurism at the University of California, Berkeley, said, “The danger is that we will surrender thinking, exploring and experimentation to tools that hew to the rules but can’t color outside the lines. Would you like computers to select the president or decide if you need hip surgery?” Dan Geer, a respondent who provided no identifying details, commented, “If you believe, as do I, that having a purpose to one’s life is all that enables both pride and happiness, then the question becomes whether AI will or will not diminish purpose.

This isn’t about robots, but rather about how humans use the internet. Donald Trump himself says that without Twitter, he could never have been elected, and Twitter continues to be his platform for polarization, insult and attacks on the institutions of accountability.” David J. Krieger, co-director of the Institute for Communication & Leadership in Lucerne, Switzerland, wrote, “The affordances of digital technologies bind people into information networks such that the network becomes the actor and intelligence as well as agency are qualities of the network as a whole and not any individual actors, whether human or non-human. Networks will have access to much more information than do any present-day actors and therefore be able to navigate complex environments, e.g., self-driving cars, personal assistants, smart cities. Typically, we will consult and cooperate with networks in all areas, but the price will be that we have no such thing as privacy. Privacy is indeed dead, but in the place of personal privacy management there will be network publicy governance [‘publicy’ is the opposite of privacy]. To ensure the use of these technologies for good instead of evil it will be necessary to dismantle and replace current divides between government and governed, workers and capitalists as well as to establish a working global governance.” Wendy M. Grossman, author of “net.wars” and technology blogger, wrote, “2030 is 12 years from now. I believe human-machine AI collaboration will be successful in many areas, but that we will be seeing, like we are now over Facebook and other social media, serious questions about ownership and who benefits. It seems likely that the limits of what machines can do will be somewhat clearer than they are now, when we’re awash in hype. We will know by then, for example, how successful self-driving cars are going to be, and the problems inherent in handing off control from humans to machines in a variety of areas will also have become clearer. The big fight is to keep people from relying on experimental systems and turning off the legacy ones too soon – which is our current situation with the internet.”  Karl M. van Meter, founding editor of the Bulletin of Sociological Methodology and author of “Computational Social Science in the Age of Big Data,” said, “The well-being of the world’s population depends on governments making ‘intelligent’ decisions based on AI or other means. Moreover, environmental change may well be the determining factor for future well-being, with or without ‘intelligent’ decisions by world governments.” '),\n",

First, security problems do not get the attention needed. Secondly, there may be use of the technology to control the population – as we see developing in China. AI methodology is focused on prediction, at least so far, so methods to improve health or general welfare are lacking. Deep learning, which is getting the big hype, does not have a clear foundation. That makes it scientifically weak.” An information administration manager responded, “We cede more and more decision-making and policy making to self-interested parties in the private sphere. Our institutions are insufficiently nimble to keep up with the policy questions that arise and attempts to regulate new industries are subverted by corrupt money politics at both the federal and state levels.” An internet pioneer said, “Nothing in our current social, economic or political structures points to a positive outcome. There is no evidence that more AI will improve the lives of most people. In fact, the opposite is likely to be the case. There will be more unemployment, less privacy, etc.” The following one-liners from anonymous respondents also tie into human agency: § An Internet Hall of Fame member commented, “AI will not leave most people better off than they are today because individuals will not be able to control their lives.”  § A professor of AI and soft computing at a university in Italy said, “Development has brought humanity past the boundary, the survival limit; it is too easy to control technology in ways that are dangerous for people.” § An assistant professor of social justice wrote, “Technology magnifies what exists (for good or bad). There is simply more bad than good to be magnified.” § A professor of digital humanities at a Silicon-Valley-area university said, “Given increasing income disparity in much of the world, my fear is that AI will be used to repress the disenfranchised and create even more privilege for the few.” § A distinguished engineer and chief scientist at major technology companies commented, “Large actors will use AI for their benefit. Individual customers may have some benefits as a side effect, at a cost of lower autonomy.” § A professor of electrical engineering and innovation based in Europe said, “People will lose control of their lives, which will remain in the hands of a small group of experts or companies.” § A respondent based in Turkey wrote, “Due to unknown logic of algorithms we will lose our autonomy over our lives and everyday life decisions; humankind is depending on AI and not learning to be algorithmically literate.” § An engineer and chief operating officer said, “AI will be used to suppress rights.” '),\n",

Many of these respondents cited concerns that the future of AI will be shaped by those driven by profit motives and power thirst. They note that many AI tools rely on individuals’ sharing of information, preferences, search strategies and data. Human values and ethics are not necessarily baked into the systems making peoples’ decisions for them. These experts worry that data-based decision-making can be prone to errors, biases, and false logic or mistaken assumptions. And these experts argue that machine-based decisions often favor “efficiencies” in the name of profit or power that are extremely unfavorable to individuals and the betterment of the human condition. Michael Kleeman, a senior fellow at the University of California, San Diego and board member at the Institute for the Future, wrote, “The utilization of AI will be disproportionate and biased toward those with more resources. In general, it will reduce autonomy, and, coupled with big data, it will reduce privacy and increase social control. There will be some areas where IA [intelligence augmentation] helps make things easier and safer, but by and large it will be a global net negative.” A professor at a major U.S. university and expert in artificial intelligence as applied to social computing said, “As AI systems take in more data and make bigger decisions, people '),\n",

The trends around democratic governance of AI are not encouraging. The big players are U.S.-based, and the U.S. is in an anti-regulation stance that seems fairly durable. Therefore, I expect AI technologies to evolve in ways that benefit corporate interests, with little possibility of meaningful public response.” Justin Reich, executive director of MIT Teaching Systems Lab and research scientist in the MIT Office of Digital Learning, responded, “Systems for human-AI collaborations will be built by powerful, affluent people to solve the problems of powerful, affluent people. In the hands of autocratic leaders, AI will become a powerful tool of surveillance and control. In capitalist economies, human-AI collaboration will be deployed to find new, powerful ways of surveilling and controlling workers for the benefit of more-affluent consumers.” Seth Finkelstein, consulting programmer at Finkelstein Consulting and EFF Pioneer Award winner, commented, “AI depends on algorithms and data. Who gets to code the algorithms and to challenge the results? Is the data owned as private property, and who can change it? As a very simple example, let’s take the topic of algorithmic recommendations for articles to read. Do they get tuned to produce suggestions which lead to more informative material – which, granted, is a relatively difficult task, and fraught with delicate determinations? Or are they optimized for ATTENTION! CLICKS! *OUTRAGE*!? To be sure, the latter is cheap and easy – and though it has its own share of political problems, they’re often more amenable to corporate management (i.e., what’s accurate vs. what’s unacceptable). There's a whole structure of incentives that will push toward one outcome or the other.” Douglas Rushkoff, professor of media at City University of New York, responded, “The main reason I believe AI’s impact will be mostly negative is that we will be applying it mostly toward the needs of the market, rather than the needs of human beings. So while AI might get increasingly good at extracting value from people, or manipulating people’s behavior toward more consumption and compliance, much less attention will likely be given to how AI can actually create value for people. Even the most beneficial AI is still being measured in terms of its ability to provide utility, value or increase in efficiency – fine values, sure, but not the only ones that matter to quality of life.” Annalie Killian, futurist and vice president for strategic partnerships at Sparks & Honey, wrote, “More technology does not make us more human; we have evidence for that now within 10 years of combining the smartphone device with persuasive and addictive designs that shape and hijack behavior.

The sophisticated tech is affordable and investible in the hands of very few people who are enriching themselves and growing their power exponentially, and these actors are NOT acting in the best interest of all people.” Collin Baker, senior AI researcher at the International Computer Science Institute at the University of California, Berkeley, commented, “I fear that advances in AI will be turned largely to the service of nation states and mega-corporations, rather than be used for truly constructive purposes. The positive potential, particularly in education and health care, is enormous, but people will have to fight to make it come about. … I hope that AI will get much better at understanding Gricean maxims for cooperative discourse and at understanding people's beliefs, intentions and plans.” Brian Harvey, lecturer on the social implications of computer technology at the University of California, Berkeley, said, “The question makes incorrect presuppositions, encapsulated in the word ‘we.’ There is no we; there are the owners and the workers. The owners (the 0.1%) will be better off because of AI. The workers (bottom 95%) will be worse off, as long as there are owners to own the AI, same as for any piece of technology.” One of the world’s foremost social scientists studying human-technology interactions said, “My chief fear is face-recognition used for social control. Even Microsoft has begged for government regulation! Surveillance of all kinds is the future for AI. It is not benign if not controlled!” Devin Fidler, futurist and founder of Rethinkery Labs commented, “If earlier industrialization is any guide, we may be moving into a period of intensified creative destruction as AI technologies become powerful enough to overturn the established institutions and the ordering systems of modern societies. If the holes punched in macro-scale organizational systems are not explicitly addressed and repaired, there will be increased pressures on everyday people as they face not only the problems of navigating an unfamiliar new technology landscape themselves, but also the systemic failure of institutions they rely on that have failed to adapt.” An anonymous respondent said, “My fear is that technology will further separate us from what makes us human and sensitive to others. My hope is that technology would be used to improve the quality of living, not supplant it. Much of the AI innovation is simply clogging our senses, stealing our time, increasing the channels and invasion of adverts. This has destroyed our phones, filled our mailboxes and crowded our email. No product is worth that level of incursion.” \"),\n",

Many problems will be solved, but many jobs are going to disappear, and there may be more poor people as a result. Will we see life extension? Maybe, and maybe not, because our dependence on technology may also be destructive to our health.” Eliot Lear, principal engineer at Cisco Systems, predicted, “AI and tech will not leave most people better off than they are today. As always, technology outpaces our ability to understand its ramifications so as to properly govern its use. I have no reason to believe that we will have caught up by 2030.” Olivia Coombe, a respondent who provided no identifying details, wrote, “Children learn from their parents. As AI systems become more complex and are given increasingly important roles in the functioning of day-to-day life, we should ask ourselves what are we teaching our artificial digital children? If we conceive and raise them in a world of individual self-interest, will they just strengthen these existing, and often oppressive, systems of capitalist competition? Or could they go their own way, aspiring to a life of entrepreneurship to collaboration? Worse yet, will they see the reverence we hold for empires and seek to build their own through conquest?” Peter Asaro, a professor at The New School and philosopher of science, technology and media who examines artificial intelligence and robotics, commented, “AI will produce many advantages for many people, but it will also exacerbate many forms of inequality in society. It is likely to benefit a small group who design and control the technology greatly, benefit a fairly larger group of the already well-off in many ways, but also potentially harm them in other ways, and for the vast majority of people in the world it will offer few visible benefits and be perceived primarily as a tool of the wealthy and powerful to enhance their wealth and power.” Mark Deuze, a professor of media studies at the University of Amsterdam, wrote, “With the advances in AI and tech, the public debate grows over their impact. It is this debate that will contribute to the ethical and moral dimensions of AI, hopefully inspiring a society-wide discussion on what we want from tech and how we will take responsibility for that desire.” Rob Frieden, professor and Pioneers Chair in Telecommunications and Law at Penn State University, said, “Any intelligent system depends on the code written to support it. If the code is flawed, the end product reflects those flaws. An old-school acronym spells this out: GIGO, Garbage In, Garbage Out. I have little confidence that AI can incorporate any and every real-world scenario, even with likely developments in machine learning. As AI expands in scope and reach, defects will have ever increasing impacts, largely on the negative side of the ledger.” '),\n",

My sense is that it will empower many (most probably 1% to 30%) and will disempower many (if not 99%). Especially problematic will be the level of complexity created for the less competent (notably the elderly) as is evident with taxation and banking systems – issues to which sysadmins are indifferent. For some it will be a boon – proactive companions (whether for quality dialogue or sex). Sysadmins will build in unfortunate biases. Missing will be the enabling of interdisciplinarity – as has long been possible but carefully designed out for the most dubious divide-and-rule reasons. Blinkered approaches and blind spots will set the scene for unexpected disasters – currently deniably incomprehensible (Black Swan effect). Advantages for governance will be questionable. Better oversight will be dubiously enabled.” Stephanie Perrin, president of Digital Discretion, a data-privacy consulting firm, wrote, “There is a likelihood that, given the human tendency to identify risk when looking at the unknown future, AI will be used to attempt to predict risk. In other words, more and deeper surveillance will be used to determine who is a good citizen (purchaser, employee, student, etc.) and who [is] bad. This will find itself into public-space surveillance systems, employee-vetting systems (note the current court case where LinkedIn is suing data scrapers who offer to predict ‘flight risk’ employees), and all kinds of home-management systems and intelligent cars. While this might possibly introduce a measure of safety in some applications, the impact of fear that comes with unconscious awareness of surveillance will have a severe impact on creativity and innovation. We need that creativity as we address massive problems in climate change and reversing environmental impacts, so I tend to be pessimistic about outcomes.” Alistair Knott, an associate professor specializing in cognitive science and AI at the University of Otago in Dunedin, New Zealand, wrote “AI has the potential for both positive and negative impacts on society. [Negative impacts are rooted in] the current dominance of transnational companies (and tech companies in particular) in global politics. These companies are likely to appropriate the majority of advances in AI technology – and they are unlikely to spread the benefit of these advances throughout society. We are currently witnessing an extraordinary concentration of wealth in the hands of a tiny proportion of the world’s population. This is largely due to the mainstreaming of neoliberalism in the world’s dominant economies – but it is intensified by the massive success of tech companies, which achieve huge profits with relatively small workforces. The advance of AI technologies is just going to continue this trend, unless quite draconian political changes are effected that bring transnational companies under proper democratic control.” Richard Forno, of the Center for Cybersecurity at the University of Maryland-Baltimore County, wrote, “AI is only as ‘smart’ and efficient as its human creators can make it.

The problem is less AI’s evolution and more about how humankind develops and uses it – that is where the real crisis in AI will turn out.” Sam Punnett, research and strategy officer at TableRock Media, wrote, “The preponderance of AI-controlled systems are designed to take collected data and enable control advantage. Most of the organizations with the resources to develop these systems do so to enable advantages in commercial/financial transactions, manufacturing efficiency and surveillance. Self-regulation by industry has already been shown to fail (e.g., social media platforms and Wall Street). Government agencies are lagging in their will and understanding of the implications of the technology to effectively implement guidelines to curtail the impacts of unforeseen circumstances. As such, government participation will be reactive to the changes that the technology will bring. My greatest fear is a reliance on faulty algorithms that absolve responsibility while failing to account for exceptions.” Luis Pereira, associate professor of electronics and nanotechnologies, Universidade NOVA de Lisboa, Portugal, responded, “I fear that more control and influence will be exerted on people, such as has started in China. There will be a greater wealth gap, benefits will not spread to all and a caste system will develop, unless a new social compact is put in place, which is unlikely. Widespread revolt is plausible.” Stavros Tripakis, an associate professor of computer science at Aalto University in Finland and adjunct professor at the University of California, Berkeley, wrote, “‘1984,’ George Orwell, police state.”  A principal architect for a top-five technology company commented, “AI will enable vicious regimes to track citizens at all times. Mistaken identifications will put innocent people in jail and even execute them with no hope of appeal. In general, AI will only have a positive contribution in truly democratic states, which are dwindling in number.” John Sniadowski, a director for a technology company, wrote, “As technology is currently instantiated it simply concentrates power into a smaller number of international corporations. That needs fixing for everyone to gain the best from AI.” David Brake, senior lecturer in communications at the University of Bedfordshire, UK, said, “Like many colleagues I fear that AI will be framed as ‘neutral’ and ‘objective’ and thereby used as cover to make decisions that would be considered unfair if made by a human.

Decisions may also be made (even more than today) based on a vast array of collected data and if we are not careful we will be unable to control the flows of information about us used to make those decisions or to correct misunderstandings or errors which can follow us around indefinitely. Imagine being subject to repeated document checks as you travel around the country because you know a number of people who are undocumented immigrants and your movements therefore fit the profile of an illegal immigrant. And you are not sure whether to protest because you don’t know whether such protests could encourage an algorithm to put you into a ‘suspicious’ category which could get you harassed even more often.” A longtime veteran of a pioneering internet company commented, “Profit motive and AI at scale nearly guarantee suffering for most people. It should be spiffy for the special people with wealth and power, though. Watching how machines are created to ensure addiction (to deliver ads) is a reminder that profit-driven exploitation always comes first. The push for driverless cars, too, is a push for increased profits.” Joshua Loftus, assistant professor of information, operations and management sciences at New York University and co-author of “Counterfactual Fairness in Machine Learning,” commented, “How have new technologies shaped our lives in the past? It depends on the law, market structure and who wields political power. In the present era of extreme inequality and climate catastrophe, I expect technologies to be used by employers to make individual workers more isolated and contingent, by apps to make users more addicted on a second-by-second basis, and by governments for surveillance and increasingly strict border control.” Eugene H. Spafford, internet pioneer and founder and executive director emeritus of the Center for Education and Research in Information Assurance and Security, commented, “Without active controls and limits, the primary adopters of AI systems will be governments and large corporations. Their use of it will be to dominate/control people, and this will not make our lives better.” Michael Muller, a researcher in the AI interactions group for a global technology solutions provider, said it will leave some people better off and others not, writing, “For the wealthy and empowered, AI will help them with their daily lives – and it will probably help them to increase their wealth and power. For the rest of us, I anticipate that AI will help the wealthy and empowered people to surveil us, to manipulate us, and (in some cases) to control us or even imprison us. For those of us who do not have the skills to jump to the AI-related jobs, I think we will find employment scarce and without protections. In my view, AI will be a mixed and intersectional blessing at best.” '),\n",

Until tech designers and engineers build privacy into each design and policy decision for consumers, any advances with human-machine/AI collaboration will leave consumers with less security and privacy.” Michael H. Goldhaber, an author, consultant and theoretical physicist who wrote early explorations on the digital attention economy, said, “For those without internet connection now, its expansion will probably be positive overall. For the rest we will see an increasing arms race between uses of control, destructive anarchism, racism, etc., and ad hoc, from-below efforts at promoting social and environmental good. Organizations and states will seek more control to block internal or external attacks of many sorts. The combined struggles will take up an increasing proportion of the world’s attention, efforts and so forth. I doubt that any very viable and democratic, egalitarian order will emerge over the next dozen years, and – even in a larger time frame – good outcomes are far from guaranteed.” Dave Burstein, editor and publisher at Fast Net News, said, “There’s far too much second-rate AI that is making bad decisions based on inadequate statistical understanding. For example, a parole or sentencing AI probably would find a correlation between growing up in a single parent household and likelihood of committing another crime. Confounding variables, like the poverty of so many single mothers, need to be understood and dealt with. I believe it’s wrong for someone to be sent to jail longer because their father left. That kind of problem, confounding variables and the inadequacy of ‘preponderant’ data, is nearly ubiquitous in AI in practice.” Ian Peter, pioneer internet activist and internet rights advocate, said, “Personal data accumulation is reaching a point where privacy and freedom from unwarranted surveillance are disappearing. In addition, the algorithms that control usage of such data are becoming more and more complex leading to inevitable distortions. Henry Kissinger may have not been far off the mark when he described artificial intelligence as leading to ‘The End of the Age of Enlightenment.’” Michael Zimmer, associate professor and privacy and information ethics scholar at the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, commented, “I am increasingly concerned that AI-driven decision making will perpetuate existing societal biases and injustices, while obscuring these harms under the false belief such systems are ‘neutral.’” '),\n",

But because AI can be used anywhere we can recognize patterns, the potential uses for artificial intelligence are pretty huge. The question is, how will it be used? … While these tools will become cheaper and more widespread, we can expect that – like smartphones or web connectivity – their uses will be primarily driven by commercial interests. We’re beginning to see the early signs of AI failing to make smart predictions in larger institutional contexts. If Amazon fails to correctly suggest the right product in the future, everything is fine. You bought a backpack once, and now Amazon thinks you want more backpacks, forever. It’ll be okay. But sometimes these decisions have enormous stakes. ProPublica documented how automated ‘risk-assessment’ software used in U.S. courtroom sentencing procedures is only slightly more accurate at predicting recidivism than the flip of a coin. Likewise, hospitals using IBM Watson to make predictions about cancer treatments find the software often gives advice that humans would not. To mitigate harm in high-stakes situations, we must critically interrogate how our assumptions about our data and the rules that we use to create our AI promote harm.” Nigel Hickson, an expert on technology policy development for ICANN based in Brussels, responded, “I am optimistic that AI will evolve in a way that benefits society by improving processes and giving people more control over what they do. This will only happen though if the technologies are deployed in a way in which benefits all. My fear is that in non-democratic countries, AI will lessen freedom, choice and hope.” Vian Bakir, a professor of political communication and journalism at Bangor University, responded, “I am pessimistic about the future in this scenario because of what has happened to date with AI and data surveillance. For instance, the recent furor over fake news/disinformation and the use of complex data analytics in the U.K.’s 2016 Brexit referendum and in the U.S. 2016 presidential election. To understand, influence and micro-target people in order to try get them to vote a certain way is deeply undemocratic. It shows that current political actors will exploit technology for personal/political gains, irrespective of wider social norms and electoral rules. There is no evidence that current bad practices would not be replicated in the future, especially as each new wave of technological progress outstrips regulators’ ability to keep up, and people’s ability to comprehend what is happening to them and their data. Furthermore, and related, the capabilities of mass dataveillance in private and public spaces is ever-expanding, and their uptake in states with weak civil society organs and minimal privacy regulation is troubling.

But moving a decision such as health care or workplace performance to AI turns it into a data-driven decision driven by optimization of some function, which in turn demands more data. Adopting AI-driven insurance ratings, for example, demands more and more lifestyle data from the insured if it is to produce accurate overall ratings. Optimized data-driven decisions about our lives unavoidably require surveillance, and once our lifestyle choices become input for such decisions we lose individual autonomy. In some cases we can ignore this data collection, but we are in the early days of AI-driven decisions: By 2030 I fear the loss will be much greater. I do hope I am wrong.” Timothy Graham, a postdoctoral research fellow in sociology and computer science at Australian National University, commented, “There is already an explosion of research into ‘fairness and representation’ in ML (and conferences such as Fairness, Accountability and Transparency in Machine Learning), as it is difficult to engineer systems that do not simply reproduce existing social inequality, disadvantage and prejudice. Deploying such systems uncritically will only result in an aggregately worse situation for many individuals, whilst a comparatively small number benefit.” A senior researcher and programmer for a major global think tank commented, “I expect AI to be embedded in systems, tools, etc., to make them more useful. However, I am concerned that AI’s role in decision-making will lead to more-brittle processes where exceptions are more difficult than today – this is not a good thing.” Jenni Mechem, a respondent who provided no identifying details, said, “My two primary reasons for saying that advances in AI will not benefit most people by 2030 are, first, there will continue to be tremendous inequities in who benefits from these advances, and second, if the development of AI is controlled by for-profit entities there will be tremendous hidden costs and people will yield control over vast areas of their lives without realizing it. … The examples of Facebook as a faux community commons bent on extracting data from its users and of pervasive internet censoring in China should teach us that neither for-profit corporations nor government can be trusted to guide technology in a manner that truly benefits everyone.

A small portion of humanity will benefit greatly from AI, while the vast majority will experience AI through constraints on life chances. Although it’s possible for us to design AI systems to advance social justice, our current trajectory will reinforce historic and structural inequality.” Dalsie Green Baniala, CEO and regulator of the Telecommunications and Radiocommunications Regulator of Vanuatu, wrote, “Often, machine decisions do not produce an accurate result, they do not meet expectations or specific needs. For example, applications are usually invented to target the developed-world market. They may not work appropriately for countries like ours – small islands separated by big waters.” Michiel Leenaars, director of strategy at NLnet Foundation and director of the Internet Society’s Netherlands chapter, responded, “Achieving trust is not the real issue; achieving trustworthiness and real empowerment of the individual is. As the technology that to a large extent determines the informational self disappears – or in practical terms is placed out of local control, going ‘underground’ under the perfect pretext of needing networked AI – the balance between societal well-being and human potential on the one hand and corporate ethics and opportunistic business decisions on the other stands to be disrupted. Following the typical winner-takes-all scenario the internet is known to produce, I expect that different realms of the internet will become even less transparent and more manipulative.

Instead, AI is most benefitting those with the most power.” Larry Lannom, internet pioneer and vice president at the Corporation for National Research Initiatives (CNRI), said, “I am hopeful that networked human-machine interaction will improve the general quality of life. ... My fear: Will all of the benefits of more-powerful artificial intelligence benefit the human race as a whole or simply the thin layer at the top of the social hierarchy that owns the new advanced technologies?” A professor and researcher in AI based in Europe noted, “Using technological AI-based capabilities will give people the impression that they have more power and autonomy. However, those capabilities will be available in contexts already framed by powerful companies and states. No real freedom. For the good and for the bad.” An anonymous respondent said, “In the area of health care alone there will be tremendous benefits for those who can afford medicine employing AI. But at the same time, there is an enormous potential for widening inequality and for abuse. We can see the tip of this iceberg now with health insurance companies today scooping up readily available, poorly protected third-party data that will be used to discriminate.” A senior data analyst and systems specialist expert in complex networks responded, “Artificial intelligence software will implement the priorities of the entities that funded development of the software. In some cases, this will [be] a generic service sold to the general public (much as we now have route-planning software in GPS units), and this will provide a definite benefit to consumers. In other cases, software will operate to the benefit of a large company but to the detriment of consumers (for example, calculating a price for a product that will be the highest that a given customer is prepared to pay).

My biggest concern is responsible gathering of information and its use. Information can be abused in many ways as we are seeing today.” A digital rights activist commented, “AI is already (through racial recognition, in particular) technologically laundering longstanding and pervasive bias in the context of police surveillance. Without algorithmic transparency and transparency into training data, AIs can be bent to any purpose.” The following one-liners from anonymous respondents also tie into this theme: § A longtime economist for a top global technology company predicted, “The decline of privacy and increase in surveillance.” § A journalist and leading internet activist wrote, “Computer AI will only be beneficial to its users if it is owned by humans, and not ‘economic AI’ (that is, corporations).” § A strategy consultant wrote, “The problem is one of access. AI will be used to consolidate power and benefits for those who are already wealthy and further surveil, disenfranchise and outright rob the remaining 99% of the world.” § A policy analyst for a major internet services provider said, “We just need to be careful about what data is being used and how.” § A professor of information science wrote, “Systems will be developed that do not protect people’s privacy and security.” § The founder of a technology research firm wrote, “Neoliberal systems function to privilege corporations over individual rights, thus AI will be used in ways to restrict, limit, categorize – and, yes, it will also have positive benefits.” § A professor of electrical and computer engineering based in Europe commented, “The problem lies in human nature. The most powerful will try to use AI and technology to increase their power and not to the benefit of society.” Other anonymous respondents commented: § “The panopticon and invasion of all personal aspects of our lives is already complete.” § “AI will allow greater control by the organized forces of tyranny, greater exploitation by the organized forces of greed and open a Pandora’s box of a future that we as a species are not mature enough to deal with.” § “The combination of widespread device connectivity and various forms of AI will provide a more pleasant everyday experience but at the expense of an even further loss of privacy.” '),\n",

Many of these experts say new jobs will emerge along with the growth of AI just as they have historically during nearly every human transition to new tools.  Brad Templeton, chair for computing at Singularity University, said, “While obviously there will be good and bad, the broad history of automation technologies is positive, even when it comes to jobs. There is more employment today than ever in history.”  Ben Shneiderman, distinguished professor and founder of the Human Computer Interaction Lab at the University of Maryland, said, “Automation is largely a positive force, which increases productivity, lowers costs and raises living standards. Automation expands the demand for services, thereby raising employment, which is what has happened at Amazon and FedEx. My position is contrary to those who believe that robots and artificial intelligence will lead to widespread unemployment. Over time I think AI/machine learning strategies will become merely tools embedded in ever-more-complex technologies for which human control and responsibility will become clearer.” Robert D.

AI has the potential to play an important role in boosting productivity and living standards.” Toby Walsh, a professor of AI at the University of New South Wales in Australia and president of the AI Access Foundation, said, “I'm pessimistic in short term – we're seeing already technologies like AI being used to make life worse for many – but I'm optimistic in long term that we’ll work out how to get machines to do the dirty, dull, dangerous and difficult, and leave us free to focus on all the more-important and human parts of our lives.” Yet many others disagree. Some fear the collapse of the middle class and social and economic upheaval if most of the world’s economic power is held by a handful of technology behemoths that are reaping the great share of financial rewards in the digital age while employing far fewer people than the leading companies of the industrial age. A fairly large share of these experts warn that if steps are not taken now to adjust to this potential future that AI’s radical reduction in human work will be devastating.” David Cake, an leader with Electronic Frontiers Australia and vice-chair of the ICANN Generic Names Supporting Organization Council, wrote, “The greatest fear is that the social disruption due to changing employment patterns will be handled poorly and lead to widespread social issues.”  Jerry Michalski, founder of the Relationship Economy eXpedition, said, “We’re far from tipping into a better social contract. In a more-just world, AI could bring about utopias. However, many forces are shoving us in the opposite direction. 1) Businesses are doing all they can to eliminate full-time employees, who get sick and cranky, need retirement accounts and raises, while software gets better and cheaper. The precariat will grow. 2) Software is like a flesh-eating bacterium: Tasks it eats vanish from the employment landscape. Unlike previous technological jumps, this one unemploys people more quickly than we can retrain and reemploy them. 3) Our safety net is terrible and our beliefs about human motivations suck. 4) Consumerism still drives desires and expectations.” James Hendler, professor of computer, web and cognitive sciences and director of the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute for Data Exploration and Application, wrote, “I believe 2030 will be a point in the middle of a turbulent time when AI is improving services for many people, but it will also be a time of great change in society based on changes in work patterns that are caused, to a great degree, by AI. On the one hand, for example, doctors will have access to information that is currently hard for them to retrieve rapidly, resulting in better medical care for those who have coverage, and indeed in some countries the first point of contact in a medical situation may be an AI, which will help with early diagnoses/prescriptions. On the other hand, over the course of a \"),\n",

Many of these will not be people ‘replaced’ by AIs, but rather the result of a smaller number of people being able to accomplish the same amount of work – for example in professions such as law clerks, physicians assistants and many other currently skilled positions we would project a need for less people (even as demand grows).” Betsy Williams, a researcher at the Center for Digital Society and Data Studies at the University of Arizona, wrote, “AI’s benefits will be unequally distributed across society. Few will reap meaningful benefits. Large entities will use AI to deliver marginal improvements in service to their clients, at the cost of requiring more data and risking errors. Employment trends from computerization will continue. AI will threaten medium-skill jobs. Instead of relying on human expertise and context knowledge, many tasks will be handled directly by clients using AI interfaces or by lower-skilled people in service jobs, boosted by AI. AI will harm some consumers. For instance, rich consumers will benefit from self-driving cars, while others must pay to retrofit existing cars to become more visible to the AI. Through legal maneuvering, self-driving car companies will avoid many insurance costs and risks, shifting them to human drivers, pedestrians and bicyclists. In education, creating high quality automated instruction requires expertise and money. Research on American K-12 classrooms suggests that typical computer-aided instruction yields better test scores than instruction by the worst teachers. By 2030, most AI used in education will be of middling quality (for some, their best alternative). The children of the rich and powerful will not have AI used on them at school; instead, they will be taught to use it. For AI to significantly benefit the majority, it must be deployed in emergency health care (where quicker lab work, reviews of medical histories or potential diagnoses can save lives) or in aid work (say, to coordinate shipping of expiring food or medicines from donors to recipients in need).” Nathaniel Borenstein, chief scientist at Mimecast, wrote, “Social analyses of IT [information technology] trends have consistently wildly exaggerated the human benefits of that technology, and underestimated the negative effects. ... I foresee a world in which IT and so-called AI produce an ever-increasing set of minor benefits, while simultaneously eroding human agency and privacy and supporting authoritarian forms of governance. I also see the potential for a much worse outcome in which the productivity gains produced by technology accrue almost entirely to a few, widening the gap between the rich and poor while failing to address the social ills related to privacy. But if we can find a way to ensure that these benefits are shared equally among the population, it might yet prove to be the case that the overall effect of the technology is beneficial to humanity. This will only happen, however, if we manage to limit the role of the rich in determining how the fruits of increased productivity will be allocated.” '),\n",

People will require training for this future – educational and technological development. … This is a very high level of human development that poor countries don't have access to. Without proper education and policies, they will not have access to wealth. The result may be a multitude of hungry and desperate people. This may be motivation for wars or invasion of borders. Future human-machine interaction (AI) will only be positive if richer countries develop policies to help poorer countries to develop and gain access to work and wealth.” Josh Calder, a partner at the Foresight Alliance, commented, “The biggest danger is that workers are displaced on a mass scale, especially in emerging markets.” Jeff Johnson, computer science professor at the University of San Francisco, previously with Xerox, HP Labs and Sun Microsystems, responded, “I believe advances in AI will leave many more people without jobs, which will increase the socioeconomic differences in society, but other factors could help mitigate this, e.g., adoption of guaranteed income.” Alan Bundy, a professor of automated reasoning at the University of Edinburgh, wrote, “Unskilled people will suffer because there will be little employment for them. This may create disruption to society, some of which we have already seen with Trump, Brexit, etc.” Peter Levine, associate dean for research and professor of citizenship and public affairs in Tufts University’s Tisch College of Civic Life, wrote, “Being a fully-fledged citizen has traditionally depended on work. I’m worried that rising levels of non-employment will detract from civic engagement. Also, AI is politically powerful and empowers the people and governments that own it. Thus, it may increase inequality and enhance authoritarianism.”  Hassaan Idrees, an electrical engineer and Fulbright Scholar active in creating energy systems for global good, commented, “I believe human-machine interaction will be more of [a] utility, and less fanciful as science fiction puts it. People will not need to see their physicians in person, their automated doctors making this irrelevant. Similarly, routine workplace activities like data processing and financial number crunching would be performed by AI. Humans with higher levels of intellect can survive this age, and those on the lower ends of spectrum of mental acumen would be rendered unnecessary.” Ethem Alpaydın, a professor of computer engineering at Bogazici University in Istanbul, responded, “As with other technologies, I imagine AI will favor the developed countries that \"),\n",

For the developing countries, however, whose labor force is mostly unskilled and whose exports are largely low-tech, AI implies higher unemployment, lower income and more social unrest. The aim of AI in such countries should be to add skill to the labor force rather than supplant them.” Sam Ladner, a former UX researcher for Amazon and Microsoft, now an adjunct professor at Ontario College of Art and Design, wrote, “Technology is not a neutral tool, but one that has our existing challenges imprinted onto it. Inequality is high and growing. Too many companies deny their employees a chance to work with dignity, whether it be through providing them meaningful things to do, or with the basic means to live. AI will be placed on top of that existing structure. Those who already have dignified work with a basic income will see that enhanced; those who are routinely infantilized or denied basic rights will see that amplified. Some may slip into that latter category because their work is more easily replaced by AI and machine learning.” Jonathan Swerdloff, consultant and data systems specialist for Driven Inc., wrote, “The more reliant on AI we become, the more we are at the mercy of its developers. While AI has the ability to augment professionals and to make decisions, I have three concerns which make me believe it will not leave us better off by 2030. This does not address fears that anything run via AI could be hacked and changed by bad faith third parties. 1) Until any sort of self-policed AI sentience is achieved, it will suffer from a significant GIGO [garbage-in, garbage-out] problem. As AI as currently conceived only knows what it is taught, the seed sets for teaching must be thought out in detail before the tools are deployed. Based on the experience with Microsoft’s Tay and some responses I've heard from the Sophia robot, I am concerned that AI will magnify humanities flaws. 2) Disparate access. Unless the cost for developing AI drops precipitously – and it may, since one AI tool could be leveraged into building further less expensive AI tools – access to whatever advantages the tools will bring will likely be clustered among a few beneficiaries. I view this akin to high frequency trading on Wall Street. Those who can, do. Those who can’t, lose. 3) Tool of control. If AI is deployed to make civic or corporate decisions, those who control the algorithms control everything. In the U.S. we’ve recently seen Immigration and Customs Enforcement change its bond algorithm to always detain in every case.” Stuart A. Umpleby, a professor and director of the research program in social and organizational learning at George Washington University, wrote, “People who use AI and the internet will have their lives enhanced by these technologies. People who do not use them will be increasingly disconnected from opportunities. As the digital world becomes more complicated and remote from real-world experiences, the need will grow for people and software to make connections. There will be a need for methods to distinguish the real world from the scam world.” \"),\n",

Metaxas, author of “Technology, Propaganda and the Limits of Human Intellect” and professor of computer science at Wellesley College, responded, “There will be a lot of wealth that AI-supported devices will be producing. The new technologies will make it easier and cheaper to produce food and entertainment massively (‘bread and circus’). This wealth will not be distributed evenly, increasing the financial gap between the top small percentage of people and the rest. Even though this wealth will not be distributed evenly, the (relatively small) share given to the vast majority of people will be enough to improve their (2018) condition. In this respect, the majority of people will be ‘better off’ than they are today. They may not feel better off if they were aware of the inequalities compared to the top beneficiaries, but they will not be aware of them due to controlled propaganda. Unfortunately, there will not be much they could do about the increased inequalities. Technologies of police enforcement by robots and lack of private communication will make it impossible for them to organize, complain or push for change. They will not be valued as workers, citizens or soldiers. The desire for democracy as we know it today will be coming to an end. Many will feel depressed, but medical products will make it easy for them to increase pleasure and decrease pain.” Grace Mutung’u, co-leader of the Kenya ICT Action Network, responded, “New technologies will more likely increase current inequalities unless there is a shift in world economics. From the experience of the UN work on Millennium Development Goals, while there has been improvement with the quality of life generally, low- and middle-income countries still suffer disparate inequalities. This will likely lead to governance problems. In any case, governments in these countries are investing heavily in surveillance which will likely have more negative effects on society.” Danny Gillane, a netizen from Lafayette, Louisiana, commented, “Technology promises so much but delivers so little. Facebook gave us the ability to stay in touch with everyone but sacrificed its integrity and our personal information in pursuit of the dollar. The promise that our medical records would be digitized and more easily shared and drive costs down still has not materialized on a global scale. The chief drivers of AI innovation and application will be for-profit companies who have shown that their altruism only extends to their bottom lines. Like most innovations, I expect AI to leave our poor even poorer and our rich even richer, increasing the numbers of the former while consolidating power and wealth in an ever-shrinking group of currently rich people.” '),\n",

AI will still be uneven in quality, and unevenly available throughout different parts of society. Privacy and security protections will be inadequate; data bias will still be common; many technologies and response patterns will be normed to the needs of the ‘common denominator’ user and misidentify or misinterpret interactions with people with disabilities or, if appropriately identifying their disability, will expose that information without user consent or control.” So many people included comments and concerns about the future of jobs for humans in their wide-ranging responses to this canvassing that a later section of this report has more expert opinions on this topic.  The following one-liners from anonymous respondents also tie into AI and jobs: § An associate professor of computer science commented, “Machines will be able to do more-advanced work and improve accuracy, but this likely will expand manipulation of consumers/voters and automation may reduce available jobs.” § A director for a global digital rights organization said, “My concern is that human-machine collaboration will leave some of us far better off by automating our jobs, giving us more free and creative time, while doing little to improve the lives of billions of others.”  § A professor expert in cultural geography and American studies said, “Given the majority human assumption that capitalism is something worth reproducing, the evacuation of most labor positions by AI would create vast poverty and cruelty by the ruling class.”  § A lecturer in media studies based in New Zealand wrote, “The automation of large volumes of work by machine learning-based systems is unlikely to lead to an increase in social equity within a capitalist economy.”  § A senior partner at one of the world’s foremost management consulting firms commented, “AI will benefit businesses, the economy and people as consumers, but likely increase income/wage polarization so most people as workers may not benefit.”  § An engineer and chief operating officer for project automating code said, “Those with the most money will leverage their position of power through AI; it will lead to possibly cataclysmic wealth disparity.  § A digital anthropologist for a major global technology company wrote, “The gap between those who benefit from advances in technology and those who do not have widened over the past three decades; I can’t see an easy or quick reversal.” '),\n",

The bifurcated economy will continue to grow. … Those at the bottom of the ladder will see greater numbers of jobs being taken away by technology.” § “All in all, AI can be of great use, but we need to be vigilant of the repercussions instead of constantly leaping ‘forward’ only to find out later about all of the negatives.” § “In the U.S., the blue-collar job wages have been stagnant since the 1970s despite all of the advances with the internet and mobile devices, so I am not optimistic regarding AI.” § “Wealth distribution will continue to widen as the rich get richer.” § “AI is going to lead to the destruction of entire rungs of the economy, and the best way to boost and economy while holding together a fractured economy is war.” § “Many people will no longer be useful in the labor market. Such rapid economic and social change will leave many frightened and angry.” §  “In 12 years AI may be more disruptive than enabling, leaving many without work until they retrain and transition.” § “There could be a thinning out of the middle – middle management and class.” § “AI will increasingly allow low-quality but passable substitutes for previously-skilled labor.” § “There are significant implications for unskilled or easily-automated tasks on one end of the spectrum and certain types of analysis on the other that will be automated away. My concern is that we have no plan for these people as these jobs disappear.” Individuals’ cognitive, social and survival skills will be diminished as they become dependent on AI   While these experts expect AI to augment humans in many positive ways, some are concerned that a deepening dependence upon machine-intelligence networks will diminish crucial human capabilities. Some maintain there has already been an erosion of people’s abilities to think for themselves, to take action independent of automated systems and to interact effectively face-to-face with others.  Charles Ess, an expert in ethics and professor with the department of media and communication at the University of Oslo, said, “It seems quite clear that evolving AI systems will bring about an extraordinary array of options, making our lives more convenient. But convenience almost always comes at the cost of deskilling – of our offloading various cognitive practices and virtues to the machines and thereby our becoming less and less capable of exercising our own agency, autonomy and most especially our judgment (phronesis).

My worst fears are not only severe degradation, perhaps more or less loss of such capacities – and, worst of all, our forgetting they even existed in the first place, along with the worlds they have made possible for us over most of our evolutionary and social history.” Daniel Siewiorek, a professor with the Human-Computer Interaction Institute at Carnegie Mellon University, predicted, “The downside: isolating people, decreasing diversity, a loss of situational awareness (witness GPS directional systems) and ‘losing the receipt’ of how to do things. In the latter case, as we layer new capabilities on older technologies if we forget how the older technology works we cannot fix it and layered systems may collapse, thrusting us back into a more-primitive time.” Marilyn Cade, longtime global internet policy consultant, responded, “Technology often reflects the ethics of its creators, but more significantly, those who commercialize it. Most individuals focus on how they personally use technology. They do not spend time (or even have the skills/expertise) to make judgments about the attributes of the way that technology is applied. … We must introduce and maintain a focus on critical thinking for our children/youth, so that they are capable of understanding the implications of a different fully digitized world. I love the fact that my typos are autocorrected, but I know how to spell all the words. I know how to construct a logical argument. If we don’t teach critical thinking at all points in education, we will have a 2030 world where the elites/scientists make decisions that are not even apparent to the average ‘person’ on the street/neighborhood.”  Garland McCoy, founder and chief development officer of the Technology Education Institute, wrote, “I am an optimist at heart and so believe that, given a decade-plus, the horror that is unfolding before our eyes will somehow be understood and resolved. That said, if the suicide epidemic we are witnessing continues to build and women continue to opt out of motherhood all bets are off. I do think technology is at the core of both the pathology and choice.” Aneesh Aneesh, professor at the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, said, “Socially, AI systems will automate tasks that currently require human negotiation and interaction. Unless people feel the pressure, institutionally or otherwise, to interact with each other, they – more often than not – choose not to interact. The lack of physical, embodied interaction is almost guaranteed to result in social loneliness and anomie, and associated problems such as suicide, a phenomenon already are on the rise in the United States.” Ebenezer Baldwin Bowles, author, editor and journalist, responded, “If one values community and the primacy of face-to-face, eye-to-eye communication, then human-machine/AI '),\n",

Every expression of daily life, either civil or professional or familial or personal, will be diminished by the iron grip of AI on the fundamental realities of interpersonal communications. Already the reliance on voice-to-text technology via smartphone interface diminishes the ability of people to write with skill and cogency. Taking the time to ring-up another and chat requires too much psychic energy, so we ‘speak’ to one another in text box fragments written down and oft altered by digital assistants. The dismissive but socially acceptable ‘TL;DR’ becomes commonplace as our collective attention span disintegrates. Yes, diagnostic medicine and assembly-line production and expanded educational curriculum will surely be enhanced by cyber-based, one-and-zero technologies, but at what cost to humanity? Is it truly easier and safer to look into a screen and listen to an electronically delivered voice, far away on the other side of an unfathomable digital divide, instead of looking into another’s eyes, perhaps into a soul, and speaking kind words to one another, and perhaps singing in unison about the wonders of the universe? We call it ‘artificial intelligence’ for good reason.” A principal design researcher at one of the world’s largest technology companies commented, “Although I have long worked in this area and been an optimist, I now fear that the goal of most AI and UX is geared toward pushing people to interact more with devices and less with other people. As a social species that is built to live in communities, reductions in social interaction will lead to erosion of community and rise in stress and depression over time. Although AI has the potential to improve lives as well, those advances will come more slowly than proponents think, due to the ‘complexity brake’ Paul Allen wrote about, among other things. There have been AI summers and AI winters. This is not an endless summer.” A chief operating officer wrote, “No doubt in my mind, AI is and will continue to present benefits in simplifying and aiding human activities; however, the net effect is not likely ‘to leave people better off.’ The advances in AI-enabled tools are likely to expand the digital gap in human competencies. This growing gap will decrease the capacity of sizable portions of the population to survive an outage of the technology. This raises humanitarian and national-security concerns.” Dalsie Green Baniala, CEO and regulator of the Telecommunications and Radiocommunications Regulator of Vanuatu, wrote, “With the introduction of the Internet of Things, human senses are in decline.” Alper Dincel of T.C.

A trucker does a lot more than merely drive a truck. A bartender does a lot more than merely pour drinks. Society will still have to deal with the effects of smart technologies encroaching ever into new parts of the labor market. A universal basic income could mitigate increasing social instability. Later on, as general AI spreads, it will become an existential threat to humanity. My estimate is that this existential threat will not begin to arise until the second half of the 21st century. Unfortunately, by then humanity might have grown complacent, since specialized AI systems do not pose an existential threat.” Mauro D. Ríos, an adviser to the E-Government Agency of Uruguay and director of the Internet Society’s Uruguay chapter, responded, “In 2030 dependence on AI will be greater in all domestic, personal, work and educational contexts; this will make the lives of many people better. However, it has risks. We must be able to maintain active survival capabilities without AI. Human freedom cannot be lost in exchange for the convenience of improving our living standards. … AI must continue to be subject to the rationality and control of the human being.” Nancy Greenwald, a respondent who provided no identifying details, wrote, “Perhaps the primary downside is overreliance on AI, which 1) is only as good as the algorithms created (how are they instructed to ‘learn?’) and 2) has the danger of limiting independent human thinking. How many Millennials can read a map or navigate without the step-by-step instructions from Waze, Google or their iPhones? And information searches online don’t give you an overview. I once wasted 1.5 billable hours searching for a legal concept when two minutes with the human based BNA outline got me the result in two minutes. Let’s be thoughtful about how we use the amazing technology.” Valarie Bell, a computational social scientist at the University of North Texas, commented, “As a social scientist I’m concerned that never before have we had more ways in which to communicate and yet we’ve never done it so poorly, so venomously and so wastefully. With devices replacing increasingly higher-order decisions and behaviors, people have become more detached, more disinterested and yet more self-focused and self-involved.” Lane Jennings, managing editor for the World Future Review from 2009 to 2015, wrote, “It is most likely that advances in AI will improve technology and thus give people new capabilities.

Fear and uncertainty could negate positive benefits after even a few highly publicized disasters.” Michael Veale, co-author of “Fairness and Accountability Designs Needs for Algorithmic Support in High-Stakes Public Sector Decision-Making” and a technology policy researcher at University College London, responded, “AI technologies will turn out to be more narrowly applicable than some hope. There will be a range of small tasks that will be more effectively automated. Whether these tasks leave individuals with increased ability to find meaning or support in life is debatable. Freed from some aspects of housework and administration, some individuals may feel empowered whereas others might feel aimless. Independent living for the elderly might be technologically mediated, but will it have the social connections and community that makes life worth living? Jobs too will change in nature, but it is not clear that new tasks will make people happy. It is important that all technologies and applications are backed up with social policies and systems to support meaning and connection, or else even effective AI tools might be isolating and even damaging on aggregate.” The following one-liners from anonymous respondents also tie into this theme: § A British-American computer scientist commented, “Increasing dependence on AI will decrease societal resilience through centralization of essential systems in a few large companies.” § A leading infrastructure engineer for a social network company commented, “AI may make people’s lives better by making some things easier, but it will likely reduce human value along the way – I expect people to be less able to make decisions, less able to tolerate human interaction, etc.”  § A representative for a nation-state’s directorate of telecommunications wrote, “My fear is that humans will become more and more dependent on AI, to the extent that their natural intelligence would be more and more diminished.

Anthony Nadler, assistant professor of media and communication studies at Ursinus College, commented, “The question has to do with how decisions will be made that shape the contingent development of this potentially life-changing technology. And who will make those decisions? In the best-case scenario, the development of AI will be influenced by diverse stakeholders representing different communities who will be affected by its implementation (and this may) mean that particular uses of AI – military applications, medical, marketing, etc. – will be overseen by reflective ethical processes. In the absolute worst-case scenario, unrestricted military development will lead to utter destruction – whether in a situations in which the ‘machines take over’ or, more likely, in which weapons of tremendous destruction become all the more readily accessible.” Jennifer J.

Even more regrettably, defending ourselves against evil – or to be polite, bad AI systems turned ugly by humans, or other machines – must become a priority for societies well before 2030, given the clear and present danger. How can I be sure? What are bots and malware doing every day, today? Is there a reason to think ‘evil-doers’ will be less motivated in the future?

People find ways to apply technologies to enhance the human spirit and the human experience, yet others can use technologies to exploit human fears and satisfy personal greed.

Humans have had millions of years to develop physically and mentally, but we've had only a few thousand years – as the world population has expanded – to develop the social skills that would allow us to live close together.’ I understand his pessimism, and it takes only a few people to use AI (or any technology) in ways that result in widespread negative societal impacts.” Frank Feather, futurist and consultant with StratEDGY, commented, “AI by 2030 .... This is only about a decade away, so despite AI's continuing evolution, it will not have major widespread effects by 2030. With care in implementation all effects should be positive in social and economic impact. That said, the changes will represent a significant step toward what I call a DigiTransHuman Future, where the utility of humans will increasingly be diminished as this century progresses, to the extent that humans may become irrelevant or extinct, replaced by DigiTransHumans and their technologies/robots that will appear and behave just like today’s humans, except at very advanced stages of humanoid development. This is not going to be a so-called ‘singularity’ and there is nothing ‘artificial’ about the DigiTransHuman Intelligence. It is part of designed evolution of the species.” John Leslie King, a computer science professor at the University of Michigan and a consultant for several years on cyberinfrastructure for the National Science Foundation’s directorates for Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE) and Social, Behavioral, and Economic (SBE) sciences, commented, “If there are evil things to be done with AI, people will find out about \"),\n",

There will be an ongoing fight like the one between hackers and IT security people.” John Markoff, fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in Behavioral Sciences at Stanford University and author of “Machines of Loving Grace: The Quest for Common Ground Between Humans and Robots,” wrote, “There are expected and unexpected consequences to ‘AI and related technologies.’ It is quite possible that improvements in living standards will be offset by the use of autonomous weapons in new kinds of war.” A veteran of a pioneering internet company commented, “In the face of managing resources and warfare – the big issues for AI at scale – the goals are not likely to be sharing and co-existence.” Dan Schultz, senior creative technologist at Internet Archive, responded, “AI will no doubt result in life-saving improvements for a huge portion of the world’s population, but it will also be possible to weaponize in ways that further exacerbate divides of any kind you can imagine (political, economic, education, privilege, etc.). AI will amplify and enable the will of those in power; its net impact on humanity will depend on the nature of that will.” Sam Gregory, director of WITNESS and digital human rights activist, responded, “Trends in AI suggest it will enable more individualized, personalized creation of synthetic media filter bubbles around people, including the use of deepfakes and related individualized synthetic audio and video micro-targeting based on personal data and trends in using AI-generated and directed bots. These factors may be controlled by increasing legislation and platform supervision, but by 2030 there is little reason to think that most peoples’ individual autonomy and ability to push back to understand the world around them will have improved.” Miguel Moreno-Muñoz, a professor of philosophy specializing in ethics, epistemology and technology at the University of Granada in Spain, said, “There is a risk of overreliance on systems with poorly experienced intelligence augmentation due to pressure to reduce costs. This could lead to major dysfunctions in health care or in the supervision of highly complex processes. A hasty application of management systems based on the Internet of Things could be problematic in certain sectors of industry, transport or health, but its advantages will outweigh its disadvantages. I do believe there may be significant risks in the military applications of AI.”  Denise N. Rall, a professor of arts and social sciences at Southern Cross University in Australia, responded, “The basic problem with the human race and its continued existence on this planet is overpopulation and depletion of the Earth's resources. So far, interactions with technology have \"),\n",

Technology may support robotic wars and reduce casualties for the wealthy countries. The disparity between rich and poor will continue unabated.” Patrick Lambe, a partner at Straits Knowledge and president of the International Society for Knowledge Organization’s Singapore chapter, wrote, “I chose the negative answer not because of a dystopian vision for AI itself and technology interaction with human life, but because I believe social, economic and political contexts will be slow to adapt to technology’s capabilities. The real-world environment and the technological capability space are becoming increasingly disjointed and out of synch. Climate change, migration pressures, political pressures, food supply and water will create a self-reinforcing ‘crisis-loop’ with which human-machine/AI capabilities will be largely out of touch. There will be some capability enhancement (e.g., medicine), but on the whole technology contributions will continue to add negative pressures to the other environmental factors (employment, job security, left-right political swings). On the whole I think these disjoints will continue to become more enhanced until a major crisis point is reached (e.g., war).” Mechthild Schmidt Feist, department coordinator for digital communications and media at New York University, said, “Historical precedent shows that inventions are just as powerful in the hands of criminals or irresponsible or uninformed people. The more powerful our communication, the more destructive it could be. We would need global, enforceable legislation to limit misuse. 1) That is highly unlikely. 2) It is hard to predict all misuses. My negative view is due to our inability to make responsible use of our current online communication and media models. The utopian freedom has become a dystopian battleground.” Marc Brenman, managing partner at IDARE LLC, said, “We do not know all that machines can do. There is no inherent necessity that they will care for us. We may be an impediment to them. They may take orders from evil-doers. They will enable us to make mistakes even faster than we do now. Any technology is only as good as the morality and ethics of its makers, programmers and controllers. If machines are programmed to care more for the earth than for people, they may eliminate us anyway, since we are destroying the earth.” Robert K. Logan, chief scientist at the Strategic Innovation Lab (sLab) at OCAT University and professor emeritus of physics at the University of Toronto, said, “The idea of the Singularity is an example of the over-extension of AI. Computers will never achieve an equivalency to human intelligence. There is no such thing as AW (artificial wisdom). AI as a tool to enhance human intelligence makes sense but AI to replace human intelligence makes no sense and therefore is nonsense.” '),\n",

Solutions to address AI’s anticipated negative impacts  A number of participants in this canvassing offered solutions to the worrisome potential future spawned by AI. Among them: 1) improving collaboration across borders and stakeholder groups; 2) developing policies to assure that development of AI will be directed at augmenting humans and the common good; and 3) shifting the priorities of economic, political and education systems to empower individuals to stay ahead in the “race with the robots.” A number of respondents sketched out overall aspirations:  Andrew Wycoff, the director of OECD’s directorate for science, technology and innovation, and Karine Perset, an economist in OECD’s digital economy policy division, commented, “Twelve years from now, we will benefit from radically improved accuracy and efficiency of decisions and predictions across all sectors. Machine learning systems will actively support humans throughout their work and play. This support will be unseen but pervasive – like electricity. As machines’ ability to sense, learn, interact naturally and act autonomously increases, they will blur the distinction between the physical and the digital world. AI systems will interconnect and work together to predict and adapt to our human needs and emotions. The growing consensus that AI should benefit society at-large leads to calls to facilitate the adoption of AI systems to promote innovation and growth, help address global challenges, and boost jobs and skills development, while at the same time establishing appropriate safeguards to ensure these systems are transparent and explainable, and respect human rights, democracy, culture, nondiscrimination, privacy and control, safety, and security. Given the inherently global nature of our networks and applications that run across then, we need to improve collaboration across countries and stakeholder groups to move toward common understanding and coherent approaches to key opportunities and issues presented by AI. This is not too different from the post-war discussion on nuclear power. We should also tread carefully toward Artificial General Intelligence and avoid current assumptions on the upper limits of future AI capabilities.” Wendy Hall, professor of computer science at the University of Southampton and executive director of the Web Science Institute, said, “By 2030 I believe that human-machine/AI collaboration will be empowering for human beings overall. Many jobs will have gone, but many new jobs will have been created and machines/AI should be helping us do things more effectively and efficiently both at home and at work. It is a leap of faith to think that by 2030 we will have learnt to build AI in a responsible way and we will have learnt how to regulate the AI and robotics industries in a way that is good for humanity. We may not have all the answers by 2030 but we need to be on the right track by then.” '),\n",

AI will allow authorities to analyse and allocate resources where there is the greatest need. AI will also change the way we work and travel. … Digital assistants that mine and analyse data will help professionals in making concise decisions in health care, manufacturing and agriculture, among others. Smart devices and virtual reality will enable humans to interact with and learn from historical or scientific issues in a more-clear manner. Using AI, authorities will be able to prevent crime before it happens. Cybersecurity needs to be at the forefront to prevent unscrupulous individuals from using AI to perpetrate harm or evil on the human race.” Ryan Sweeney, director of analytics at Ignite Social Media, commented, “Our technology continues to evolve at a growing rate, but our society, culture and economy are not as quick to adapt. We’ll have to be careful that the benefits of AI for some do not further divide those who might not be able to afford the technology. What will that mean for our culture as more jobs are automated? We will need to consider the impact on the current class divide.” Susan Mernit, executive director of The Crucible and co-founder and board member of Hack the Hood, responded, “If AI is in the hands of people who do not care about equity and inclusion, it will be yet another tool to maximize profit for a few.” The next three sections of this report focus on solutions most often mentioned by respondents to this canvassing.

In my area, health, there is tremendous potential in the confluence of advances in big data analysis and genomics to create personalised medicine and improve diagnosis, treatment and research. Although I am optimistic about human capacity for adaptation, learning, and evolution, technological innovation will not always proceed smoothly. In this we can learn from previous technological revolutions. For example, [Bank of England chief economist] Andy Haldane rightly pointed out that the original ‘luddites’ in the 19th century had a justified grievance. They suffered severe job losses, and it took the span of a generation for enough jobs to be created to overtake the ones lost. It is a reminder that the introduction of new technologies benefits people asymmetrically, with some suffering while others benefit. To realise the opportunities of the future we need to acknowledge this and prepare sufficient safety nets, such as well-funded adult education initiatives, to name one example. It’s also important to have an honest dialogue between the experts, the media and the public about the use of our personal data for social-good projects, like health care, taking in both the risks of acting – such as effects on privacy – and the opportunity costs of not acting. It is a fact that lives are lost currently in health systems across the world that could be saved even with today’s technology let alone that of 2030.” Edson Prestes, a professor and director of robotics at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, responded, “We must understand that all domains (technological or not) have two sides: a good and a bad one. To avoid the bad one we need to create and promote the culture of AI/Robotics for good. We need to stimulate people to empathize toward others. We need to think about potential issues, even if they have small probability to happen. We need to be futurists, foreseeing potential negative events and how to circumvent them before they happen. We need to create regulations/laws (at national and international levels) to handle globally harmful situations for humans, other living beings and the environment. Applying empathy, we should seriously think about ourselves and others – if the technology will be useful for us and others and if it will not cause any harm. We cannot develop solutions without considering people and the ecosystem as the central component of development. If so, the pervasiveness of AI/robotics in the future will diminish any negative impact and create a huge synergy among people and environment, improving people’s daily lives in all domains while achieving environment sustainability.” Adam Nelson, a software developer for one of the “big five” global technology companies, said, “Human-machine/AI collaboration will be extremely powerful, but humans will still control intent. If human governance isn’t improved, AI will merely make the world more efficient. But the goals won’t be human welfare. They’ll be wealth aggregation for those in power.” '),\n",

Global human rights and human-machine/AI technology can and must scale together. If applied as an extension of the human experience, human-machine/AI collaboration will revolutionize our understanding of the world around us.” Fiona Kerr, industry professor of neural and systems complexity at the University of Adelaide, commented, “The answer depends very much on what we decide to do regarding the large questions around ensuring equality of improved global health; by agreeing on what productivity and worth now look like, partly supported by the global wage; through fair redistribution of technology profits to invest in both international and national social capital; through robust discussion on the role of policy in rewarding technologists and businesses to build quality partnerships between humans and AI; through the growth of understanding in the neurophysiological outcomes of human-human and human-technological interaction which allows us to best decide what not to technologies, when a human is more effective, and how to ensure we maximise the wonders of technology as an enabler of a human-centric future.” Benjamin Kuipers, a professor of computer science at the University of Michigan, wrote, “We face several critical choices between positive and negative futures. … Advancing technology will provide vastly more resources; the key decision is whether those resources will be applied for the good of humanity as a whole or if they will be increasingly held by a small elite. Advancing technology will vastly increase opportunities for communication and surveillance. The question is whether we will find ways to increase trust and the possibilities for productive cooperation among people or whether individuals striving for power will try to dominate by decreasing trust and cooperation. In the medium term, increasing technology will provide more powerful tools for human, corporate or even robot actors in society. The actual problems will be about how members of a society interact with each other. In a positive scenario, we will interact with conversational AIs for many different purposes and even when the AI belongs to a corporation we will be able to trust that it takes what in economics is called a ‘fiduciary’ stance toward each of us. That is, the information we provide must be used primarily for our individual benefit. Although we know, and are explicitly told, that our aggregated information is valuable to the corporation, we can trust that it will not be used for our manipulation or our disadvantage.” \"),\n",

At the same time the concomitant increase in the levels of education and health will allow us to develop new social philosophies and rework our polities to transform human well-being. AI increases the disruption of the old social order, making the new transformation both necessary and more likely, though not guaranteed.” Wangari Kabiru, author of the MitandaoAfrika blog, based in Nairobi, Kenya, commented, “In 2030, advancing AI and tech will not leave most people better off than they are today, because our global digital mission is not strong enough and not principled enough to assure that ‘no, not one is left behind’ – perhaps intentionally. The immense positive-impact potential for enabling people to achieve more in nearly every area of life – the full benefits of human-machine/AI collaboration can only be experienced when academia, civil society and other institutions are vibrant, enterprise is human-values-based, and governments and national constitutions and global agreements place humanity first. … Engineering should serve humanity and never should humanity be made to serve the exploits of engineering. More people MUST be creators of the future of LIFE – the future of how they live, future of how they work, future of how their relationships interact and overall how they experience life. Beyond the coexistence of human-machine, this creates synergy.” A professor expert in AI connected to a major global technology company’s projects in AI development wrote, “Precision democracy will emerge from precision education, to incrementally support the best decisions we can make for our planet and our species. The future is about sustaining our planet. As with the current development of precision health as the path from data to wellness, so too will artificial intelligence improve the impact of human collaboration and decision-making in sustaining our planet. ” Some respondents argued that individuals must do better at taking a more active role in understanding and implementing the decision-making options available to them in these complex, code-dependent systems. \"),\n",

A growing concern is the collection and potential uses of data about people’s day-to-day lives. ‘Something’ always knows where we are, the layout of the house, what’s in the fridge and how much we slept. The convenience provided by these tools will override caution about data collection, so strong privacy protection must be legislated and culturally nurtured. We need to learn to be responsible for our personal data and aware of when and how it is collected and used.” Peng Hwa Ang, professor of communications at Nanyang Technological University and author of “Ordering Chaos: Regulating the Internet,” commented, “AI is still in its infancy. A lot of it is ruled-based and not demanding of true intelligence or learning. But even so, I find it useful. My car has lane-assistance. I find that it makes me a better driver. When AI is more full-fledged, it would make driving safer and faster. I am using AI for some work I am doing on sentiment analysis. I find that I am able to be more creative in asking questions to be investigated. I expect AI will compel greater creativity. Right now, the biggest fear of AI is that it is a black-box operation – yes, the factors chosen are good and accurate and useful, but no one knows why those criteria are chosen. We know the percentages of the factors, but we do not know the whys. Hopefully, by 2030, the box will be more transparent. That's on the AI side. On the human side, I hope human beings understand that true AI will make mistakes. If not, it is not real AI. This means that people have got to be ready to catch the mistakes that AI will make. It will be very good. But it will (still) not be foolproof.” Bert Huang, an assistant professor in the department of computer science at Virginia Tech focused on machine learning, wrote, “AI will cause harm (and it has already caused harm), but its benefits will outweigh the harm it causes. That said, the [historical] pattern of technology being net positive depends on people seeking positive things to do with the technology, so efforts to guide research toward societal benefits will be important to ensure the best future.” An anonymous respondent said, “We should ensure that values (local or global) and basic philosophical theories on ethics inform the development and implementation of AI systems.”  Develop policies to assure that development of AI will be directed at augmenting humans and the common good  Many experts who shared their insights in this study suggested there has to be an overall change in the development, regulation and certification of autonomous systems. They generally said the goal should be values-based, inclusive, decentralized, networks “imbued with empathy” that help individuals assure that technology meets social and ethical responsibilities for the common good.  \"),\n",

AI technologies have the potential to do so much good in the world: identify disease in people and populations, discover new medications and treatments, make daily tasks like driving simpler and safer, monitor and distribute energy more efficiently, and so many other things we haven’t yet imagined or been able to realize. And – like any tectonic shift – AI creates its own type of disruption. We’ve seen this with every major invention from the Gutenberg press to the invention of the semiconductor. But AI is different. Replication of some human capabilities using data and algorithms has ethical consequences. Algorithms aren’t neutral; they replicate and reinforce bias and misinformation. They can be opaque. And the technology and means to use them rests in the hands of a select few organizations, at least today.” Bryan Johnson, founder and CEO of Kernel, a leading developer of advanced neural interfaces, and OS Fund, a venture capital firm, said, “We could start with owning our own digital data and the data from our bodies, minds and behavior, and then follow by correcting our major tech companies’ incentives away from innovation for everyday convenience and toward radical human improvement. As an example of what tech could look like when aligned with radical human improvement, cognitive prosthetics will one day give warnings about biases – like how cars today have sensors letting you know when you drift off to sleep or if you make a lane change without a signal – and correct cognitive biases and warn an individual away from potential cognitive biases. This could lead to better behaviors in school, home and work, and encourage people to make better health decisions.” Marc Rotenberg, executive director of Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC), commented, “The challenge we face with the rise of AI is the growing opacity of processes and decision-making.

The other issue underlying the ‘human-AI augmentation’ narrative rarely discussed is the economic underpinnings driving all technology manufacturing. Where exponential growth, shareholder models are prioritized human and environmental well-being diminishes. Multiple reports from people like Joseph Stiglitz point out that while AI will greatly increase GDP in the coming decades, the benefits of these increases will favor the few versus the many. It’s only by adopting ‘Beyond GDP’ or triple-bottom-line metrics that ‘people, planet and profit’ will shape a holistic future between humans and AI.” Greg Lloyd, president and co-founder at Traction Software, presented a future scenario: “By 2030 AIs will augment access and use of all personal and networked resources as highly skilled and trusted agents for almost every person – human or corporate. These agents will be bound to act in accordance with new laws and regulations that are fundamental elements of their construction much like Isaac Asimov’s ‘Three Laws of Robotics’ but with finer-grain ‘certifications’ for classes of activities that bind their behavior and responsibility for practices much like codes for medical, legal, accounting and engineering practice. Certified agents will be granted access to personal or corporate resources, and within those bounds will be able to converse, take direction, give advice and act like trusted servants, advisers or attorneys. Although these agents will ‘feel’ like intelligent and helpful beings, they will not have any true independent will or consciousness, and must not pretend to be human beings or act contrary to the laws and regulations that bind their behavior. Think Ariel and Prospero.” Tracey P. Lauriault, assistant professor of critical media and big data at Carleton University’s School of Journalism and Communication, commented, “[What about] regulatory and policy interventions to protect citizens from potentially harmful outcomes, AI auditing, oversight, transparency and accountability? Without some sort of principles of a systems-based framework to ensure that AI remains ethical and in the public interest, in a stable fashion, then I must assume that AI will impede agency and could lead to decision-making that can be harmful, biased, inaccurate and not able to dynamically change with changing values.

The sovereignty of the user of the system must remain total.” Joseph Turow, professor of communication at the University of Pennsylvania, wrote, “Whether or not AI will improve society or harm it by 2030 will depend on the structures governing societies of the era. Broadly democratic societies with an emphasis on human rights might encourage regulations that push AI in directions that help all sectors of the nation. Authoritarian societies will, by contrast, set agendas for AI that further divide the elite from the rest and use technology to cultivate and reinforce the divisions. We see both tendencies today; the dystopian one has the upper hand especially in places with the largest populations. It is critical that people who care about future generations speak out when authoritarian tendencies of AI appear.” Henry E. Brady, dean of the Goldman School of Public Policy at the University of California, Berkeley, wrote, “I believe that policy responses can be developed that will reduce biases and find a way to accommodate AI and robotics with human lives.” Jennifer King, director of privacy at Stanford Law School’s Center for Internet and Society, said, “Unless we see a real effort to capture the power of AI for the public good, I do not see an overarching public benefit by 2030. The shift of AI research to the private sector means that AI will be developed to further consumption, rather than extend knowledge and public benefit.” Gary Kreps, distinguished professor of communication and director of the Center for Health and Risk Communication at George Mason University, wrote, “The tremendous potential for AI to be used to engage and adapt information content and computer services to individual users can make computing increasingly helpful, engaging and relevant. However, to achieve these outcomes, AI needs to be programmed with the user in mind. For example, AI services should be user-driven, adaptive to individual users, easy to use, easy to understand and easy for users to control.

If ‘the people’ will continue to have a substantive say on how society is run, then the state needs to increase its technical capabilities to ensure proper oversight of these companies. Tech in general and AI in particular will promote the advancement of humanity in every area by allowing processes to scale efficiently, reducing the costs and making more services available to more people (including quality health care, mobility, education, etc.). The open question is how these changes will affect power dynamics. To operate effectively, AI requires a broad set of infrastructure components, which are not equally distributed. These include data centers, computing power and big data. What is more concerning is that there are reasons to expect further concentration. On the one hand, data scales well: The upfront (fixed) costs of setting up a datacenter are large compared to the cost of keeping it running. Therefore, the cost of hosting each extra datum is marginally lower than the previous one. Data is the fuel of AI, and therefore whoever gets access to more data can develop more effective AI. On the other hand, AI creates efficiency gains by allowing companies to automate more processes, meaning whoever gets ahead can undercut competitors. This circle fuels concentration. As more of our lives are managed by technology there is a risk that whoever controls these technologies gets too much power. The benefits in terms of quality of life and the risks to people’s autonomy and control over politics are qualitatively different and there cannot (and should not) be up for tradeoffs.” Meryl Alper, an assistant professor of communication at Northeastern University and a faculty associate at Harvard University’s Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society, wrote, “My fear is that AI tools will be used by a powerful few to further centralize resources and marginalize people. These tools, much like the internet itself, will allow people to do this ever more cheaply, quickly and in a far-reaching and easily replicable manner, with exponentially negative impacts on the environment. Preventing this in its worst manifestations will require global industry regulation by government officials with hands-on experience in working with AI tools on the federal, state and local level, and transparent audits of government AI tools by grassroots groups of diverse (in every sense of the term) stakeholders.” David Wilkins, instructor in computer science at the University of Oregon, responded, “AI must be able to explain the basis for its decisions.” '),\n",

The positive uses of AI will dominate as they will be selected for their value to people. I trust the work by industry, academia and civil society to continue to play an important role in moderating the technology, such as pursuing understandings of the potential costly personal, social and societal influences of AI. I particularly trust the guidance coming from the long-term, ongoing One Hundred Year Study on AI and the efforts of the Partnership on AI.” Peter Stone, professor of computer science at the University of Texas at Austin and chair of the first study panel of the One Hundred Year Study on Artificial Intelligence (AI100), responded, “As chronicled in detail in the AI100 report, I believe that there are both significant opportunities and significant challenges/risks when it comes to incorporating AI technologies into various aspects of everyday life. With carefully crafted industry-specific policies and responsible use, I believe that the potential benefits outweigh the risks. But the risks are not to be taken lightly.” Anita Salem, systems research and design principal at SalemSystems, warned of a possible dystopian outcome, “Human-machine interaction will result in increasing precision and decreasing human relevance unless specific efforts are made to design in ‘humanness.’ For instance, AI in the medical field will aid more precise diagnosis, will increase surgical precision and will increase evidence-based analytics. If designed correctly, these systems will allow the humans to do what they do best –provide empathy, use experience-based intuition and utilize touch and connection as a source of healing. If human needs are left out of the design process, we’ll see a world where humans are increasingly irrelevant and more easily manipulated. We could see increasing under-employment leading to larger wage gaps, greater poverty and homelessness, and increasing political alienation. We’ll see fewer opportunities for meaningful work, which will result in increasing drug and mental health problems and the further erosion of the family support system. Without explicit efforts to humanize AI design, we’ll see a population that is needed for purchasing, but not creating. This population will need to be controlled and AI will provide the means for this control: law enforcement by drones, opinion manipulation by bots, cultural homogeny through synchronized messaging, election systems optimized from big data and a geopolitical system dominated by corporations that have benefited from increasing efficiency and lower operating costs.” Chris Newman, principal engineer at Oracle, commented, “As it becomes more difficult for humans to understand how AI/tech works, it will become harder to resolve inevitable problems. A better outcome is possible with a hard push by engineers and consumers toward elegance and simplicity (e.g., Steve-Jobs-era Apple).” '),\n",

While the benefits of AI/automation will accrue very quickly for the 1%, it will take longer for the rest of the populace to feel any benefits, and that’s ONLY if our representative leaders DELIBERATELY enact STRONG social and fiscal policy. For example, AI will save billions in labor costs – and also cut the bargaining power of labor in negotiations with capital. Any company using AI technologies should be heavily taxed, with that money going into strong social welfare programs like job retraining and federal jobs programs. For another example, any publicly funded AI research should be prevented from being privatized. The public ought to see the reward from its own investments. Don’t let AI follow the pattern of Big Pharma’s exploitation of the public-permitted Bayh-Dole Act.” Ken Birman, a professor in the department of computer science at Cornell University, responded, “By 2030, I believe that our homes and offices will have evolved to support app-like functionality, much like the iPhone in my pocket. People will customize their living and working spaces, and different app suites will support different lifestyles or special needs. For example, think of a young couple with children, a group of students sharing a home or an elderly person who is somewhat frail. Each would need different forms of support. This ‘applications’ perspective is broad and very flexible. But we also need to ensure that privacy and security are strongly protected by the future environment. I do want my devices and apps linked on my behalf, but I don’t ever want to be continuously spied-upon. I do think this is feasible, and as it occurs we will benefit in myriad ways.” Martin Geddes, a consultant specializing in telecommunications strategies, said, “The unexpected impact of AI will be to automate many of our interactions with systems where we give consent and to enable a wider range of outcomes to be negotiated without our involvement. This requires a new presentation layer for the augmented reality metaverse, with a new ‘browser’ – the Guardian Avatar – that helps to protect our identity and our interests.” Lindsey Andersen, an activist at the intersection of human rights and technology for Freedom House and Internews, now doing graduate research at Princeton University, commented, “Already, there is an overreliance on AI to make consequential decisions that affect people’s lives. We have rushed to use AI to decide everything, from what content we see on social media to assigning credit scores to determining how long a sentence a defendant should serve. While often well-intentioned, these uses of AI are rife with ethical and human rights issues, from perpetuating racial bias to violating our rights to privacy and free expression. If we have not dealt with these problems through smart regulation, consumer/buyer education and establishment of norms across the AI industry, we could be looking at a vastly more unfair, polarized and surveilled world in 2030.” '),\n",

If these conditions are met, computers and machines can process data at unprecedented speed and at an unrivaled precision level, and this will improve the quality of life, especially in medical and healthcare sectors. It has already been proven and widely shared among medical expert groups that doctors perform better in detecting diseases when they work with AI. Robotics for surgery is also progressing, so this will also benefit the patients as they can assist human surgeons who inevitably face physical limits when they conduct surgeries.” Mark Maben, a general manager at Seton Hall University, wrote, “The AI revolution is, sadly, likely to be dystopian. At present, governmental, educational, civic, religious and corporate institutions are ill-prepared to handle the massive economic and social disruption that will be caused by AI. I have no doubt that advances in AI will enhance human capacities and empower some individuals, but this will be more than offset by the fact that artificial intelligence and associated technological advances will mean far fewer jobs in the future. Sooner than most individuals and societies realize, AI and automation will eliminate the need for retail workers, truck drivers, lawyers, surgeons, factory workers and other professions. In order to ensure that the human spirit thrives in a world run and ruled by AI, we will need to change the current concept of work. That is an enormous task for a global economic system in which most social and economic benefits come from holding a traditional job. We are already seeing a decline in democratic institutions and a rise in authoritarianism due to economic inequality and the changing nature of work. If we do not start planning now for the day when AI results in complete disruption of employment, the strain is likely to result in political instability, violence and despair. This can be avoided by policies that provide for basic human needs and encourage a new definition of work, but the behavior to date by politicians, governments, corporations and economic elites gives me little confidence in their ability to lead us through this transition.” Eduardo Vendrell, a computer science professor at the Polytechnic University of Valencia in Spain, responded, “These advances will have a noticeable impact on our privacy, since the basis for this application is focused on the information we generate with the use of different technologies. … It will be necessary to regulate in a decisive way the access to the information and its use.” Yoram Kalman, an associate professor at the Open University of Israel and member of The Center for Internet Research at the University of Haifa, wrote, “The main risk is when communication and analysis technologies are used to control others, to manipulate them, or to '),\n",

These risks are ever-present and can be mitigated through societal awareness and education, and through regulation that identifies entities that become very powerful thanks to a specific technology or technologies, and which use that power to further strengthen themselves. Such entities – be they commercial, political, national, military, religious or any other – have in the past tried and succeeded in leveraging technologies against the general societal good, and that is an ever-present risk of any powerful innovation. This risk should make us vigilant but should not keep us from realizing one of the most basic humans urges: the strive to constantly improve the human condition.” Sam Gregory, director of WITNESS and digital human rights activist, responded, “We should assume all AI systems for surveillance and population control and manipulation will be disproportionately used and inadequately controlled by authoritarian and non-democratic governments. These governments and democratic governments will continue to pressure platforms to use AI to monitor for content, and this monitoring, in and of itself, will contribute to the data set for personalization and for surveillance and manipulation. To fight back against this dark future we need to get the right combination of attention to legislation and platform self-governance right now, and we need to think about media literacy to understand AI-generated synthetic media and targeting. We should also be cautious about how much we encourage the use of AI as a solution to managing content online and as a solution to, for example, managing hate speech.” Jonathan Kolber, futurist, wrote, “My fear is that, by generating AIs that can learn new tasks faster and more reliably than people can do, the future economy will have only evanescent opportunities for most people. My hope is that we will begin implementing a sustainable and viable universal basic income, and in particular Michael Haines' MUBI proposal. (To my knowledge, the only such proposal that is sustainable and can be implemented in any country at any time.) I have offered a critique of alternatives. Given that people may no longer need depend on their competitive earning power in 2030, AI will empower a far better world. If, however, we fail to implement a market-oriented universal basic income or something equally effective, vast multitudes will become unemployed and unemployable without means to support themselves. That is a recipe for societal disaster.” Walid Al-Saqaf, senior lecturer at Södertörn University, member of the board of trustees of the Internet Society (ISOC) and vice president of the ISOC Blockchain Special Interest Group, commented, “The challenge is to ensure that the data used for AI procedures is reliable.

AI has a lot of potential. It should be used to add to and not replace human intellect and judgement.” Danny O'Brien, international director for a nonprofit digital rights group, commented, “I'm generally optimistic about the ability of humans to direct technology for the benefit of themselves and others. I anticipate human-machine collaboration to take place at an individual level, with tools and abilities that enhance our own judgment and actions, rather than this being a power restricted to a few actors. So, for instance, if we use facial-recognition or predictive tools, it will be under the control of an end-user, transparent and limited to personal use. This may require regulation, internal coding restraints or a balance being struck between user capabilities. But I'm hopeful we can get there.” Fernando Barrio, director of the law program at the Universidad Nacional de Río Negro in Argentina, commented, “The interaction between humans and networked AI could lead to a better future for a big percentage of the population. In order to do so efforts need to be directed not only at increasing AI development and capabilities but also at positive policies to increase the availability and inclusiveness of those technologies. The challenge is not technical; it is sociopolitical.” Paul Jones, professor of information science at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, responded, “AI as we know it in 2018 is just beginning to understand itself. Like HAL, it will have matured by 2030 into an understanding of its post-adolescent self and of its relationship to humans and to the world. But, also, humans will have matured in our relationship to AI. Like all adolescent relationships there will have been risk taking and regrets and hopefully reconciliation. Language was our first link to other intelligences, then books, then the internet – each a more intimate conversation than the one before. AI will become our link, adviser and to some extent our wise loving companion.” Jean-Claude Heudin, a professor with expertise in AI and software engineering at the De Vinci Research Center at Pole Universitaire Leonard de Vinci in France, wrote, “Natural intelligence and artificial intelligence are complementary. We need all of the possible intelligence possible for solving the problems yet to come. More intelligence is always better.” Bryan Alexander, futurist and president of Bryan Alexander Consulting, responded, “I hope we will structure AI to enhance our creativity, to boost our learning, to expand our relationships worldwide, to make us physically safer and to remove some drudgery.” \"),\n",

Scott Burleigh, software engineer and intergalactic internet pioneer, wrote, “Advances in technology itself, including AI, always increase our ability to change the circumstances of reality in ways that improve our lives. It also always introduces possible side effects that can make us worse off than we were before. Those effects are realized when the policies we devise for using the new technologies are unwise. I don't worry about technology; I worry about stupid policy. I worry about it a lot, but I am guardedly optimistic; in most cases I think we eventually end up with tolerable policies.” Jeff Jarvis, director of the Tow-Knight Center at City University of New York’s Craig Newmark School of Journalism, commented, “What worries me most is worry itself: An emerging moral panic that will cut off the benefits of this technology for fear of what could be done with it. What I fear most is an effort to control not just technology and data but knowledge itself, prescribing what information can be used for before we know what those uses could be. I could substitute ‘book’ for ‘AI’ and the year 1485 (or maybe 1550) for 2030 in your question and it’d hold fairly true. Some thought it would be good, some bad; both end up right. We will figure this out. We always have. Sure, after the book there were wars and other profound disturbances. But in the end, humans figure out how to exploit technologies to their advantage and control them for their safety. I’d call that a law of society. The same will be true of AI. Some will misuse it, of course, and that is the time to identify limits to place on its use – not speculatively before. Many more will use it to find economic, societal, educational and cultural benefit and we need to give them the freedom to do so.” Some respondents said no matter how society comes together to troubleshoot AI concerns there will still be problems. Dave Gusto, professor of political science and co-director of the Consortium for Science, Policy & Outcomes at Arizona State University, said, “The question asked about ‘most people.’ Most people in the world live a life that is not well regarded by technology, technology developers and AI. I don’t see that changing much in the next dozen years.” A longtime Silicon Valley communications professional who has worked at several of the top tech companies over the past few decades responded, “AI will continue to improve *if* quality human input is behind it. If so, better AI will support service industries at the top of the funnel, leaving humans to handle interpretation, decisions and applied knowledge. Medical data-gathering for earlier diagnostics comes to mind. Smarter job-search processes, environmental data collection for climate-change actions – these applications all come to mind.” \"),\n",

That will bring bigger dangers to mankind. The need will be to balance growth with safety, e.g., social media is good and bad. The ways to protect from evil mongers are not sufficient. Tracing an attacker/evil monger in a global village to control and punish is the need. AI will give birth to an artificial human being who could be an angel or a devil. Plan for countering evil at every development stage.” A changemaker working for digital accessibility wrote, “There is no reason to assume some undefined force will be able to correct for or ameliorate the damage of human nature amplified with power-centralizing technologies. There is no indication that governments will be able to counterbalance power-centralization trends, as governments, too, take advantage of such market failures. The outward dressing of such interactions is probably the least important aspect of it.” An information-science futurist commented, “I fear that powerful business interests will continue to put profits above all else, closing their eyes to the second- and third-order effects of their decisions. I fear that we do not have the political will to protect and promote the common interests of citizens and democracy. I fear that our technological tools are advancing more quickly than our ability to manage them wisely. I have, however, recently spotted new job openings with titles like ‘Director of Research, Policy and Ethics in AI’ and ‘Architect, AI Ethical Practice’ at major software companies. There are reasons for hope.” The following one-liners from anonymous respondents also tie into this theme: § An open-source technologist in the automotive industry wrote, “We’ll have to have independent AI systems with carefully controlled data access, clear governance and individuals’ right to be forgotten.” § A research professor of international affairs at a major university in Washington, D.C., responded, “We have to find a balance between regulations designed to encourage ethical nondiscriminatory use, transparency and innovation.” § A director for a major regional internet registry said, “The ability of government to properly regulate advanced technologies is not keeping up with the evolution of those technologies. This allows many developments to proceed without sufficient notice, analysis, vetting or regulation to protect the interests of citizens (Facebook being a prime example).” § A professor at a major Silicon-Valley-area university said, “If technological advances are not integrated into a vision of holistic, ecologically sustainable, politically equitable social visions, they will simply serve gated and locked communities.” '),\n",

The central question is for whom will life be better, and for whom will it be worse? Some people will benefit from AI, but many will not. For example, folks on the middle and lower end of the income scale will see their jobs disappear as human-machine/AI collaborations become lower-cost and more efficient. Though such changes could generate societal benefits, they should not be born on the backs of middle- and low-income people.” § “Results will be determined by the capacity of political, criminal justice and military institutions to adapt to rapidly evolving technologies.” § “To assure the best future, we need to ramp up efforts in the areas of decentralizing data ownership, education and policy around transparency.” § “Most high-end AI knowhow is and will be controlled by a few giant corporations unless government or a better version of the United Nations step in to control and oversee them.” § “Political change will determine whether AI technologies will benefit most people or not. I am not optimistic due to the current growth of authoritarian regimes and the growing segment of the super-rich elite who derive disproportionate power over the direction of society from their economic dominance.” § “Mechanisms must be put in place to ensure that the benefits of AI do not accrue only to big companies and their shareholders. If current neo-liberal governance trends continue, the value-added of AI will be controlled by a few dominant players, so the benefits will not accrue to most people. There is a need to balance efficiency with equity, which we have not been doing lately.” Shift the priorities of economic, political and education systems to empower individuals to stay ahead in the ‘race with the robots’ A share of these experts suggest the creation of policies, regulations or ethical and operational standards should shift corporate and government priorities to focus on the global advancement of humanity, rather than profits or nationalism.

In light of current events, it’s hard to be optimistic that such an agenda will have the resources necessary to keep pace with transformative uses of AI throughout ever-increasing aspects of society. To course-correct in time it's necessary for the general public to develop a deep appreciation about why leading ideologies concerning the market, prosperity and security are not in line with human flourishing.” Nicholas Beale, leader of the strategy practice at Sciteb, an international strategy and search firm, commented, “All depends on how responsibly AI is applied. AI ‘done right’ will empower. But unless Western CEOs improve their ethics it won't. I'm hoping for the best.” Benjamin Shestakofsky, an assistant professor of sociology at the University of Pennsylvania specializing in digital technology’s impacts on work, said, “Policymakers should act to ensure that citizens have access to knowledge about the effects of AI systems that affect their life chances and a voice in algorithmic governance. The answer to this question will depend on choices made by citizens, workers, organizational leaders and legislators across a broad range of social domains. For example, algorithmic hiring systems can be programmed to prioritize efficient outcomes for organizations or fair outcomes for workers. The profits produced by technological advancement can be broadly shared or can be captured by the shareholders of a small number of high-tech firms.” Charles Zheng, a researcher into machine learning and AI with the National Institute of Mental Health, wrote, “To ensure the best future, politicians must be informed of the benefits and risks of AI and pass laws to regulate the industry and to encourage open AI research. My hope is that AI algorithms advance significantly in their ability to understand natural language, and also in their ability to model humans and understand human values. My fear is that the benefits of AI are restricted to the rich and powerful without being accessible to the general public.” Mary Chayko, author of “Superconnected: The Internet, Digital Media, and Techno-Social Life,” said, “We will see regulatory oversight of AI geared toward the protection of those who use it. Having said that, people will need to remain educated as to AI’s impacts on them and to mobilize as needed to limit the power of companies and governments to intrude on their spaces, lives and civil rights.

In fact the experience in China has shown how this technology can be used to take away the freedoms and rights of the individual for the purposes of security, efficiency, expediency and whims of the state. On the commercial side, we also do not have any controls in play as to ethical AI. Five elements should be included – transparency, explainability, reversibility, coachability and human-led processes in the design.” John Willinsky, professor and director of the Public Knowledge Project at Stanford Graduate School of Education, said, “Uses of AI that reduce human autonomy and freedom will need to be carefully weighed against the gains in other qualities of human life (e.g., driverless cars that improve traffic and increase safety). By 2030, deliberations over such matters will be critical to the functioning of ‘human-machine/AI collaboration.’ My hope, however, is that these deliberations are not framed as collaborations between what is human and what is AI but will be seen as the human use of yet another technology, with the wisdom of such use open to ongoing human consideration and intervention intent on advancing that sense of what is most humane about us.” A professor of media studies at a U.S. university commented, “Technology will be a material expression of social policy. If that social policy is enacted through a justice-oriented democratic process, then it has a better chance of producing justice-oriented outcomes. If it is enacted solely by venture-funded corporations with no obligation to the public interest, most people in 2030 will likely be worse off.” Gene Crick, director of the Metropolitan Austin Interactive Network and longtime community telecommunications expert, wrote, “To predict AI will benefit ‘most’ people is more hopeful than certain. … AI can benefit lives at work and home – if competing agendas can be balanced. Key support for this important goal could be technology professionals’ acceptance and commitment regarding social and ethical responsibilities of our work.” Anthony Picciano, a professor of education at the City of New York University’s Interactive Technology and Pedagogy program, responded, “I am concerned that profit motives will lead some companies and individuals to develop AI applications that will threaten, not necessarily improve, our way of life.

But that tactical win comes at a strategic loss as long as the primary application of AI is to extract more money from people, because that puts them in opposition to our interests as a species, helping to enrich a few people at the expense of everyone else. In AI that exploits human psychological weaknesses to sell us things, we have for the first time created something that effectively predates our own species. That’s a fundamentally bad idea and requires regulation just as surely as would self-replicating biological weapons.” Ethem Alpaydın, a professor of computer engineering at Bogazici University in Istanbul, responded, “AI will favor the developed countries that actually develop these technologies. AI will help find cures for various diseases and overall improve the living conditions in various ways. For the developing countries, however, whose labor force is mostly unskilled and whose exports are largely low-tech, AI implies higher unemployment, lower income and more social unrest. The aim of AI in such countries should be to add skill to the labor force rather than supplant them. For example, automatic real-time translation systems (e.g., Google’s Babel fish) would allow people who don’t speak a foreign language to find work in the tourism industry.” Joe Whittaker, a former professor of sciences and associate director of the NASA GESTAR program, now associate provost at Jackson State University, said, “Actions should be taken to make the internet universally available and accessible, provide the training and know-how for all users.” John Paschoud, councilor for the London borough of Lewisham, said, “It is possible that advances in AI and networked information will benefit ‘most’ people, but this is highly dependent upon on how those benefits are shared. ... If traditional capitalist models of ‘ownership of the means of production’ prevail, then benefits of automated production will be retained by the few who own, not the many who work. Similarly, models of housing, health care, etc., can be equitably distributed and can all be enhanced by technology.” David Schlangen, a professor of applied computational linguistics at Bielefeld University in Germany, responded, “If the right regulations are put in place and ad-based revenue models can be controlled in such a way that they cannot be exploited by political interest groups, the potential for AI-based information search and decision support is enormous.

To avoid that, one thing we need to do is ensure the development of ethical standards for the development of AI and ensure that we deal with algorithmic bias. We need to build ethics into our development processes. Further, I assume that tracking and monitoring of people will be an accepted part of life and that there will be stronger regulation on privacy and data security. Every facet of life will be circumscribed by AI, and it will be part of the fabric of our lives.” David Zubrow, associate director of empirical research at Carnegie Mellon University’s Software Engineering Institute, said, “How the advances are used demands wisdom, leadership and social norms and values that respect and focus on making the world better for all; education and health care will reach remote and underserved areas, for instance. The fear is control is consolidated in the hands of few that seek to exploit people, nature and technology for their own gain. I am hopeful that this will not happen.” Francisco S. Melo, an associate professor of computer science at Instituto Superior Técnico in Lisbon, Portugal, responded, “I expect that AI technology will contribute to render several services (in health, assisted living, etc.) more efficient and humane and, by making access to information more broadly available, contribute to mitigate inequalities in society. However, in order for positive visions to become a reality, both AI researchers and the general population should be aware of the implications that such technology can have, particularly in how information is used and the ways by which it can be manipulated. In particular, AI researchers should strive for transparency in their work, in order to demystify AI and minimize the possibility of misuse; the general public, on the other hand, should strive to be educated in the responsible and informed use of technology.” Kyung Sin Park, internet law expert and co-founder of Open Net Korea, responded, “AI consists of software and training data. Software is already being made available on an open source basis. What will decide AI’s contribution to humanity will be whether data (used for training AI) will be equitably distributed. Data-protection laws and the open data movement will hopefully do the job of making more data available equally to all people. I imagine a future where people can access AI-driven diagnosis of symptoms, which will drastically reduce health care costs for all.” Doug Schepers, chief technologist at Fizz Studio, said, “AI/ML, in applications and in autonomous devices and vehicles, will make some jobs obsolete, and the resulting unemployment will cause some economic instability that impacts society as a whole, but most individuals will be better off. The social impact of software and networked systems will get increasingly complex, so ameliorating that software problem with software agents may be the only way to decrease harm to '),\n",

It is a consequence of the capital investment that seeks to replace expensive professionals. Universities have to rethink what type of graduates to prepare, especially in areas of health, legal and engineering, where the greatest impact is expected, since the labor displacement of doctors, engineers and lawyers is a reality with the incipient developed systems.” Stephen Abram, principal at Lighthouse Consulting Inc., wrote, “I am concerned that individual agency is lost in AI and that appropriate safeguards should be in place around data collection as specified by the individual. I worry that context can be misconstrued by government agencies like ICE, IRS, police, etc. There is a major conversation needed throughout the time during which AI applications are developed, and they need to be evergreen as innovation and creativity spark new developments. Indeed, this should not be part of a political process, but an academic, independent process guided by principles and not economics and commercial entities.” David Klann, consultant and software developer at Broadcast Tool & Die, responded, “AI and related technologies will continue to enhance peoples’ lives. I tend toward optimism; I instinctively believe there are enough activists who care about the ethics of AI that the technology will be put to use solving problems that humans cannot solve on their own. Take mapping, for instance. I recently learned about congestion problems caused by directions being optimized for individuals. People are now tweaking the algorithms to account for multiple people taking the ‘most efficient route’ that had become congested and was causing neighborhood disturbance due to the increased traffic. I believe people will construct AI algorithms to learn of and to ‘think ahead’ about such unintended consequences and to avoid them before they become problems. Of course, my fear is that money interests will continue to wield an overwhelming influence over AI and machine learning (ML). These can be mitigated through fully disclosed techniques, transparency and third-party oversight. These third parties may be government institutions or non-government organizations with the strength to ‘enforce’ ethical use of the technologies. Open source code and open ML training data will contribute significantly to this mitigation.” Andrian Kreye, a journalist and documentary filmmaker based in Germany, said, “If humanity is willing to learn from its mistakes with low-level AIs like social media algorithms there might be a chance for AI to become an engine for equality and progress. Since most digital development is driven by venture capital, experience shows that automation and abuse will be the norm.” '),\n",

We have to make data unbiased before putting it into AI, but it's not very easy.” An anonymous respondent wrote, “There are clearly advances associated with AI, but the current global political climate gives no indication that technological advancement in any area will improve most lives in the future. We also need to think ecologically in terms of the interrelationship between technology and other social-change events. For example, medical technology has increased lifespans, but the current opioid crisis has taken many lives in the U.S. among certain demographics.” A founder and president said, “The future of AI is more about the policies we choose and the projects we choose to fund. I think there will be large corporate interests in AI that serve nothing but profits and corporations’ interests. This is the force for the ‘bad.’ However, I also believe that most technologists want to do good, and that most people want to head in a direction for the common good. In the end, I think this force will win out.” A senior strategist in regulatory systems and economics for a top global telecommunications firm wrote, “If we do not strive to improve society, making the weakest better off, the whole system may collapse. So, AI had better serve to make life easier for everyone.”   \"),\n",

Improvements ahead: How humans and AI might evolve together in the next decade  Other questions to the experts in this canvassing invited their views on the hopeful things that will occur in the next decade and for examples of specific applications that might emerge. What will human-technology co-evolution look like by 2030? Participants in this canvassing expect the rate of change to fall in a range anywhere from incremental to extremely impactful. Generally, they expect AI to continue to be targeted toward efficiencies in workplaces and other activities, and they say it is likely to be embedded in most human endeavors.  The greatest share of participants in this canvassing said automated systems driven by artificial intelligence are already improving many dimensions of their work, play and home lives and they expect this to continue over the next decade. While they worry over the accompanying negatives of human-AI advances, they hope for broad changes for the better as networked, intelligent systems are revolutionizing everything, from the most pressing professional work to hundreds of the little “everyday” aspects of existence. One respondent’s answer covered many of the improvements experts expect as machines sit alongside humans as their assistants and enhancers. An associate professor at a major university in Israel wrote, “In the coming 12 years AI will enable all sorts of professions to do their work more efficiently, especially those involving ‘saving life’: individualized medicine, policing, even warfare (where attacks will focus on disabling infrastructure and less in killing enemy combatants and civilians). In other professions, AI will enable greater individualization, e.g., education based on the needs and intellectual abilities of each pupil/student. Of course, there will be some downsides: greater unemployment in certain ‘rote’ jobs (e.g., transportation drivers, food service, robots and automation, etc.).” This section begins with experts sharing mostly positive expectations for the evolution of humans and AI. It is followed by separate sections that include their thoughts about the potential for AI-human partnerships and quality of life in 2030, as well as the future of jobs, health care and education. AI will be integrated into most aspects of life, producing new efficiencies and enhancing human capacities Many of the leading experts extolled the positives they expect to continue to expand as AI tools evolve to do more things for more people.

For example, the Cambridge Analytica case has shown us the huge privacy issues of modern social networks in a market economy, but, overall, people value the extraordinary services Facebook offers to improve communication opportunities, sharing capabilities and so on.” Vint Cerf, Internet Hall of Fame member and vice president and chief internet evangelist at Google, said, “I see AI and machine learning as augmenting human cognition a la Douglas Engelbart. There will be abuses and bugs, some harmful, so we need to be thoughtful about how these technologies are implemented and used, but, on the whole, I see these as constructive.” Mícheál Ó Foghlú, engineering director and DevOps Code Pillar at Google’s Munich office, said, “The trend is that AI/ML models in specific domains can out-perform human experts (e.g., certain cancer diagnoses based on image-recognition in retina scans). I think it would be fairly much the consensus that this trend would continue, and many more such systems could aid human experts to be more accurate.” Craig Mathias, principal at Farpoint Group, an advisory firm specializing in wireless networking and mobile computing, commented, “Many if not most of the large-scale technologies that we all depend upon – such as the internet itself, the power grid, and roads and highways – will simply be unable to function in the future without AI, as both solution complexity and demand continue to increase.” Matt Mason, a roboticist and the former director of the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University, wrote, “AI will present new opportunities and capabilities to improve the human experience. While it is possible for a society to behave irrationally and choose to use it to their detriment, I see no reason to think that is the more likely outcome.” Mike Osswald, vice president of experience innovation at Hanson Inc., commented, “I’m thinking of a world in which people’s devices continuously assess the world around them to keep a population safer and healthier.

Although AI will be disruptive through 2030 and beyond, meaning that there will be losers in the workplace and growing reasons for concern about privacy and AI/cyber-related crime, on the whole I expect that individuals and societies will make choices on use and restriction of use that benefit us. Examples include likely self-driving vehicles at that time, when my wife's deteriorating vision and that of an increased elderly population will make it increasingly liberating. I would expect rapid growth in use for informal/non-traditional education as well as some more ambivalent growth in the formal-education sector. Big-data applications in health-related research should be increasingly productive, and health care delivery should benefit. Transparency with respect to its character and use, including its developers and their personal benefits, is especially important in limiting the inevitable abuse.” Dana Klisanin, psychologist, futurist and game designer, predicted, “People will increasingly realize the importance of interacting with each other and the natural world and they will program AI to support such goals, which will in turn support the ongoing emergence of the ‘slow movement.’ For example, grocery shopping and mundane chores will be allocated to AI (smart appliances), freeing up time for preparation of meals in keeping with the slow food movement. Concern for the environment will likewise encourage the growth of the slow goods/slow fashion movement. The ability to recycle, reduce, reuse will be enhanced by the use of in-home 3D printers, giving rise to a new type of ‘craft’ that is supported by AI. AI will support the ‘cradle-to-grave’ movement by making it easier for people to trace the manufacturing process from inception to final product.” Liz Rykert, president at Meta Strategies, a consultancy that works with technology and complex organizational change, responded, “The key for networked AI will be the ability to diffuse equitable responses to basic care and data collection. If bias remains in the programming it will be a big problem. I believe we will be able to develop systems that will learn from and reflect a much broader and more diverse population than the systems we have now.” Michael R. Nelson, a technology policy expert for a leading network services provider who worked as a technology policy aide in the Clinton administration, commented, “Most media reports focus on how machine learning will directly affect people (medical diagnosis, self-driving cars, etc.) but we will see big improvements in infrastructure (traffic, sewage treatment, supply chain, etc.).” \"),\n",

As with many new technologies, the benefits will not apply equally, potentially expanding the haves-and-have-nots dichotomy. In addition, as AI delves into new fields – including creative work such as design, music/art composition – we may see new legal challenges about illegal appropriation of intellectual property (via machine learning). However, the new legal tasks from such litigation may not need a conventional lawyer – but could be handled by AI itself. Professional health care AI poses another type of dichotomy. For patients, AI could be a bonanza, identifying ailments, often in early stages (based on early symptoms), and recommending treatments. At the same time, such automated tasks could impact employment for medical professionals. And again, there are legal challenges to be determined, such as liability in the case of a wrong action by the AI. Overall, there is no such thing as ‘most people,’ but many individuals and groups – especially in professional situations – WILL live better lives thanks to AI, albeit with some severe adjustment pains.” Tim Morgan, a respondent who provided no identifying details, said, “Algorithmic machine learning will be our intelligence amplifier, exhaustively exploring data and designs in ways humans alone cannot. The world was shocked when IBM’s Deep Blue computer beat Garry Kasparov in 1997. What emerged later was the realization that human and AI ‘centaurs’ could combine to beat anyone, human or AI. The synthesis is more than the sum of the parts.” Marshall Kirkpatrick, product director of influencer marketing, responded, “If the network can be both decentralized and imbued with empathy, rather than characterized by violent exploitation, then we’re safe. I expect it will land in between, hopefully leaning toward the positive. For example, I expect our understanding of self and freedom will be greatly impacted by an instrumentation of a large part of memory, through personal logs and our data exhaust being recognized as valuable just like when we shed the term ‘junk DNA.’ Networked AI will bring us new insights into our own lives that might seem as far-fetched today as it would have been 30 years ago to say, ‘I’ll tell you what music your friends are discovering right now.’ AI is most likely to augment humanity for the better, but it will take longer and not be done as well as it could be. Hopefully we’ll build it in a way that will help us be comparably understanding to others.” Daniel A. Menasce, professor of computer science at George Mason University, commented, “AI and related technologies coupled with significant advances in computer power and decreasing costs will allow specialists in a variety of disciplines to perform more efficiently and will allow non-specialists to use computer systems to augment their skills.

For these applications to become reality, easy-to-use user interfaces, or better yet transparent user interfaces will have to be developed.” David Wells, chief financial officer at Netflix, responded, “Technology progression and advancement has always been met with fear and anxiety, giving way to tremendous gains for humankind as we learn to enhance the best of the changes and adapt and alter the worst. Continued networked AI will be no different but the pace of technological change has increased, which is different and requires us to more quickly adapt. This pace is different and presents challenges for some human groups and societies that we will need to acknowledge and work through to avoid marginalization and political conflict. But the gains from better education, medical care and crime reduction will be well worth the challenges.” Rik Farrow, editor of ;login: for the USENIX association, wrote, “Humans do poorly when it comes to making decisions based on facts, rather than emotional issues. Humans get distracted easily. There are certainly things that AI can do better than humans, like driving cars, handling finances, even diagnosing illnesses. Expecting human doctors to know everything about the varieties of disease and humans is silly. Let computers do what they are good at.” Steve Crocker, CEO and co-founder of Shinkuro Inc. and Internet Hall of Fame member, responded, “AI and human-machine interaction has been under vigorous development for the past 50 years. The advances have been enormous. The results are marbled through all of our products and systems. Graphics, speech [and] language understanding are now taken for granted. Encyclopedic knowledge is available at our fingertips. Instant communication with anyone, anywhere exists for about half the world at minimal cost. The effects on productivity, lifestyle and reduction of risks, both natural and man-made, have been extraordinary and will continue. As with any technology, there are opportunities for abuse, but the challenges for the next decade or so are not significantly different from the challenges mankind has faced in the past. Perhaps the largest existential threat has been the potential for nuclear holocaust. In comparison, the concerns about AI are significantly less.” James Kadtke, expert on converging technologies at the Institute for National Strategic Studies at the U.S. National Defense University, wrote, “Barring the deployment of a few different radically new technologies, such as general AI or commercial quantum computers, the internet and AI [between now and 2030] will proceed on an evolutionary trajectory. Expect internet access and sophistication to be considerably greater, but not radically different, and also expect that malicious actors using the internet will have greater sophistication and power. Whether we can control both these trends for positive outcomes is a public policy issue more than a technological one.” '),\n",

We will use these adaptive algorithmic tools to explore whole new domains in every industry and field of study: materials science, biotech, medicine, agriculture, engineering, energy, transportation and more. … This goes beyond computability into human relationships. AIs are beginning to understand and speak the human language of emotion. The potential of affective computing ranges from productivity-increasing adaptive interfaces, to ‘pre-crime’ security monitoring of airports and other gathering places, to companion ‘pets’ which monitor their aging owners and interact with them in ways that improve their health and disposition. Will there be unseen dangers or consequences? Definitely. That is our pattern with our tools. We invent them, use them to improve our lives and then refine them when we find problems. AI is no different.”  Ashok Goel, director of the human-centered computing Ph.D. program at Georgia Tech, wrote, “Human-AI interaction will be multimodal: We will directly converse with AIs, for example. However, much of the impact of AI will come in enhancing human-human interaction across both space (we will be networked with others) and time (we will have access to all our previously acquired knowledge). This will aid, augment and amplify individual and collective human intelligence in unprecedented and powerful ways.”  David Cake, an leader with Electronic Frontiers Australia and vice-chair of the ICANN GNSO Council, wrote, “In general, machine learning and related technologies have the capacity to greatly reduce human error in many areas where it is currently very problematic and make available good, appropriately tailored advice to people to whom it is currently unavailable, in literally almost every field of human endeavour.” Fred Baker, an independent networking technologies consultant, longtime leader in the Internet Engineering Task Force and engineering fellow with Cisco, commented, “In my opinion, developments have not been ‘out of control,’ in the sense that the creation of Terminator's Skynet or the HAL 9000 computer might depict them. Rather, we have learned to automate processes in which neural networks have been able to follow data to its conclusion (which we call ‘big data’) unaided and uncontaminated by human intuition, and sometimes the results have surprised us. These remain, and in my opinion will remain, to be interpreted by human beings and used for our purposes.” Bob Frankston, software innovation pioneer and technologist based in North America, wrote, “It could go either way.

I am bullish on human-machine interactions developing a better understanding of and improving our daily routines. I think in particular of the working parent, often although certainly not exclusively a woman, who carries so much information in their head. What if a human-machine collaboration could stock the house with essentials, schedule the pre-camp pediatrician appointments and prompt drivers for the alternate-side parking/street cleaning rules. The ability for narrow AI to assimilate new information (the bus is supposed to come at 7:10 but a month into the school year is known to actually come at 7:16) could keep a family connected and informed with the right data, and reduce the mental load of household management.” John McNutt, a professor in the school of public policy and administration at the University of Delaware, responded, “Throwing out technology because there is a potential downside is not how human progress takes place. In public service, a turbulent environment has created a situation where knowledge overload can seriously degrade our ability to do the things that are essential to implement policies and serve the public good. AI can be the difference between a public service that works well and one that creates more problems than it solves.” Randy Marchany, chief information security officer at Virginia Tech and director of Virginia Tech’s IT Security Laboratory, said, “AI-human interaction in 2030 will be in its ‘infancy’ stage. AI will need to go to ‘school’ in a manner similar to humans. They will amass large amounts of data collected by various sources but need ‘ethics’ training to make good decisions. Just as kids are taught a wide variety of info and some sort of ethics (religion, social manners, etc.), AI will need similar training. Will AI get the proper training? Who decides the training content?” Robert Stratton, cybersecurity expert, said, “While there is widespread acknowledgement in a variety of disciplines of the potential benefits of machine learning and artificial intelligence technologies, progress has been tempered by their misapplication. Part of data science is knowing the right tool for a particular job. As more-rigorous practitioners begin to gain comfort and apply these tools to other corpora it’s reasonable to expect some significant gains in efficiency, insight or profitability in many fields. This may not be visible to consumers except through increased product choice, but it may include everything from drug discovery to driving.” A data analyst for an organization developing marketing solutions said, “Assuming that policies are in place to prevent the abuse of AI and programs are in place to find new jobs for those who would be career-displaced, there is a lot of potential in AI integration.

The rest of AI usage will be its integration into more tedious and repetitive tasks across career fields. Implementing AI in this fashion will open up more time for humans to focus on long-term and in-depth tasks that will allow further and greater societal progression. For example, AI can be trained to identify and codify qualitative information from surveys, reviews, articles, etc., far faster and in greater quantities than even a team of humans can. By having AI perform these tasks, analysts can spend more time parsing the data for trends and information that can then be used to make more-informed decisions faster and allow for speedier turn-around times. Minor product faults can be addressed before they become widespread, scientists can generate semiannual reports on environmental changes rather than annual or biannual.” Helena Draganik, a professor at the University of Gdańsk in Poland, responded, “AI will not change humans. It will change the relations between them because it can serve as an interpreter of communication. It will change our habits (as an intermediation technology). AI will be a great commodity. It will help in cases of health problems (diseases). It will also generate a great ‘data industry’ (big data) market and a lack of anonymity and privacy. Humanity will more and more depend on energy/electricity. These factors will create new social, cultural, security and political problems.” There are those who think there won’t be much change by 2030. Christine Boese, digital strategies professional, commented, “I believe it is as William Gibson postulated, ‘The future is already here, it just not very evenly distributed.’ What I know from my work in user-experience design and in exposure to many different Fortune 500 IT departments working in big data and analytics is that the promise and potential of AI and machine learning is VASTLY overstated. There has been so little investment in basic infrastructure, entire chunks of our systems won't even be interoperable. The AI and machine learning code will be there, in a pocket here, a pocket there, but system-wide, it is unlikely to be operating reliably as part of the background radiation against which many of us play and work online.” An anonymous respondent wrote, “While various deployments of new data science and computation will help firms cut costs, reduce fraud and support decision-making that involves access to more information than an individual can manage, organisations, professions, markets and regulators (public and private) usually take many more than 12 years to adapt effectively to a constantly changing set of technologies and practices.

The immense valuations awarded Google, Facebook, Amazon, Tesla, et al., rely on this machine-dominance hype to sell infinite scaling. As with all hype, pretending reality does not exist does not make reality go away. Moore’s Law does not concede the future to machines, because human domination of the planet does not owe to computation. Any road map granting machines self-determination includes ‘miracle’ as one of the steps. You cannot turn a piece of wood into a real boy. AI merely ‘models’ human activity. No amount of improvement in the development of these models turns the ‘model’ into the ‘thing.’ Robot reverence attempts plausibility by collapsing the breadth of human potential and capacities. It operates via ‘denialism’ with advocates disavowing the importance of anything they cannot model. In particular, super AI requires pretending human will and consciousness do not exist. Human beings remain the source of all intent and the judge of all outcomes. Machines provide mere facilitation and mere efficiency in the journey from intent to outcome. The dehumanizing nature of automation and the diseconomy of scale of human intelligence is already causing headaches that reveal another AI Winter arriving well before 2030.” Paul Kainen, futurist and director of the Lab for Visual Mathematics at Georgetown University, commented, “Quantum cat here: I expect complex superposition of strong positive, negative and null as typical impact for AI.

Clay Shirky, writer and consultant on the social and economic effects of internet technologies and vice president at New York University, said, “All previous forms of labor-saving devices, from the level to the computer, have correlated with increased health and lifespan in the places that have adopted them.”  Jamais Cascio, research fellow at the Institute for the Future, wrote, “Although I do believe that in 2030 AI will have made our lives better, I suspect that popular media of the time will justifiably highlight the large-scale problems: displaced workers, embedded bias and human systems being too deferential to machine systems. But AI is more than robot soldiers, autonomous cars or digital assistants with quirky ‘personalities.’ Most of the AI we will encounter in 2030 will be in-the-walls, behind-the-scenes systems built to adapt workspaces, living spaces and the urban environment to better suit our needs. Medical AI will keep track of medication and alert us to early signs of health problems. Environmental AI will monitor air quality, heat index and other indicators relevant to our day’s tasks. Our visual and audio surroundings may be altered or filtered to improve our moods, better our focus or otherwise alter our subconscious perceptions of the world. Most of this AI will be functionally invisible to us, as long as it’s working properly. The explicit human-machine interface will be with a supervisor system that coordinates all of the sub-AI – and undoubtedly there will be a lively business in creating supervisor systems with quirky personalities.” '),\n",

The steady removal of human emotion-driven discrimination will rebalance social organizations creating true equitable opportunity to all people for the first time in human history. People will be part of these systems as censors, in the old imperial Chinese model, providing human emotional intelligence where that is needed to smooth social management. All aspects of human existence will be affected by the integration of AI into human societies. Historically this type of base paradigmatic change is both difficult and unstoppable. The results will be primarily positive but will produce problems both in the process of change and in totally new types of problems that will result from the ways that people do adapt the new technology-based processes.” Mark Crowley, an assistant professor, expert in machine learning and core member of the Institute for Complexity and Innovation at the University of Waterloo in Ontario, Canada, wrote, “While driving home on a long commute from work the human will be reading a book in the heads-up screen of the windshield. The car will be driving autonomously on the highway for the moment. The driver will have an idea to note down and add to a particular document; all this will be done via voice. In the middle of this a complicated traffic arrangement will be seen approaching via other networked cars. The AI will politely interrupt the driver, put away the heads-up display and warn the driver they may need to take over in the next 10 seconds or so. The conversation will be flawless and natural, like Jarvis in ‘Avengers,’ even charming. But it will be tasks-focused to the car, personal events, notes and news.” Theodore Gordon, futurist, management consultant and co-founder of the Millennium Project, commented, “There will be ups and downs, surely, but the net is, I believe, good. The most encouraging uses of AI will be in early warning of terror activities, incipient diseases and environmental threats and in improvements in decision-making.” Yvette Wohn, director of the Social Interaction Lab and expert on human-computer interaction at the New Jersey Institute of Technology, said, “One area in which artificial intelligence will become more sophisticated will be in its ability to enrich the quality of life so that the current age of workaholism will transition into a society where leisure, the arts, entertainment and culture are able to enhance the well-being of society in developed countries and solve issues of water production, food growth/distribution and basic health provision in developing countries.” Ken Goldberg, distinguished chair in engineering, director of AUTOLAB’s and CITRIS’ “people and robots” initiative, and founding member of the Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research Lab at the University of California, Berkeley, said, “As in the past 50+ years, AI will be combined with IA '),\n",

One example might be an AI-based ‘Devil's Advocate’ that would challenge my decisions with insightful questions (as long as I can turn it off periodically).” Rich Ling, a professor of media technology at Nanyang Technological University, responded, “The ability to address complex issues and to better respond to and facilitate the needs of people will be the dominant result of AI.” An anonymous respondent wrote, “There will be an explosive increase in the number of autonomous cognitive agents (e.g., robots), and humans will interact more and more with them, being unaware, most of the time, if it is interactivity with a robot or with another human. This will increase the number of personal assistants and the level of service.” Fred Davis, mentor at Runway Incubator in San Francisco, responded, “As daily a user of the Google Assistant on my phone and both Google Home and Alexa, I feel like AI has already been delivering significant benefits to my daily life for a few years. My wife and I take having an always-on omnipresent assistant on hand for granted at this point. Google Home’s ability to tell us apart and even respond with different voices is a major step forward in making computers people-literate, rather than the other way around. There’s always a concern about privacy, but so far it hasn’t caused us any problems. Obviously, this could change and instead of a helpful friend I might look at these assistants as creepy strangers. Maintaining strict privacy and security controls is essential for these types of services.” Andrew Tutt, an expert in law and author of “An FDA for Algorithms,” which called for “critical thought about how best to prevent, deter and compensate for the harms that they cause,” said, “AI will be absolutely pervasive and absolutely seamless in its integration with everyday life. It will simply become accepted that AI are responsible for ever-more-complex and ever-more-human tasks. By 2030, it will be accepted that when you wish to hail a taxi the taxi will have no driver – it will be an autonomously driven vehicle. Robots will be responsible for more-dynamic and complex roles in manufacturing plants and warehouses. Digital assistants will play an important and interactive role in everyday interactions ranging from buying a cup of coffee to booking a salon appointment. It will no longer be unexpected to call a restaurant to book a reservation, for example, and speak to a ‘digital’ assistant who will pencil you in. These interactions will be incremental but become increasingly common and increasingly normal. My hope is that the increasing integration of AI into everyday life will vastly increase the amount of time that people can devote to tasks they find meaningful.” \"),\n",

Schomaker, professor at the University of Groningen and scientific director of the Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Engineering (ALICE) research institute, said, “In the 1990s, you went to a PC on a desktop in a room in your house. In the 2010s you picked a phone from your pocket and switched it on. By 2030 you will be online 24/7 via miniature devices such as in-ear continuous support, advice and communications.” Michael Wollowski, associate professor of computer science and software engineering at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology and expert in the Internet of Things, diagrammatic systems, and artificial intelligence, wrote, “Assuming that industry and government are interested in letting the consumer choose and influence the future, there will be many fantastic advances of AI. I believe that AI and the Internet of Things will bring about a situation in which technology will be our guardian angel. For example, self-driving cars will let us drive faster than we ever drove before, but they will only let us do things that they can control. Since computers have much better reaction time than people, it will be quite amazing. Similarly, AI and the Internet of Things will let us conduct out lives to the fullest while ensuring that we live healthy lives. Again, it is like having a guardian angel that lets us do things, knowing they can save us from stupidity.” Steve King, partner at Emergent Research, said, “2030 is less than 12 years away. So … the most likely scenario is AI will have a modest impact on the lives of most humans over this time frame. Having said that, we think the use of AI systems will continue to expand, with the greatest growth coming from systems that augment and complement human capabilities and decision-making. This is not to say there won’t be negative impacts from the use of AI. Jobs will be replaced, and certain industries will be disrupted. Even scarier, there are many ways AI can be weaponized. But like most technological advancements, we think the overall impact of AI will be additive – at least over the next decade or so.” Vassilis Galanos, a Ph.D. student and teaching assistant actively researching future human-machine symbiosis at the University of Edinburgh, commented, “2030 is not that far away, so there is no room for extremely utopian/dystopian hopes and fears. … Given that AI is already used in everyday life (social-media algorithms, suggestions, smartphones, digital assistants, health care and more), it is quite probable that humans will live in a harmonious co-existence with AI as much as they do now – to a certain extent – with computer and internet technologies.” Charlie Firestone, communications and society program executive director and vice president at the Aspen Institute, commented, “I remain optimistic that AI will be a tool that humans will use, far more widely than today, to enhance quality of life such as medical remedies, education and the environment. For example, the AI will help us to conserve energy in homes and in transportation by identifying exact times and temperatures we need, identifying sources of energy that will be the '),\n",

There certainly are dire scenarios, particularly in the use of AI for surveillance, a likely occurrence by 2030. I am hopeful that AI and other technologies will identify new areas of employment as it eliminates many jobs.” Pedro U. Lima, an associate professor of computer science at Instituto Superior Técnico in Lisbon, Portugal, said, “Overall, I see AI-based technology relieving us from repetitive and/or heavy and/or dangerous tasks, opening new challenges for our activities. I envisage autonomous mobile robots networked with a myriad of other smart devices, helping nurses and doctors at hospitals in daily activities, working as a ‘third hand’ and (physical and emotional) support to patients. I see something similar happening in factories, where networked robot systems will help workers on their tasks, relieving them from heavy duties.” John Laird, a professor of computer science and engineering at the University of Michigan, responded, “There will be a continual off-loading of mundane intellectual and physical tasks on to AI and robotic systems. In addition to helping with everyday activities, it will significantly help the mentally and physically impaired and disabled. There will also be improvements in customized/individualized education and training of humans, and conversely, the customization of AI systems by everyday users. We will be transitioning from current programming practices to user customization. Automated driving will be a reality, eliminating many deaths but also having significant societal changes.” Steven Polunsky, director of the Alabama Transportation Policy Research Center at the University of Alabama, wrote, “AI will allow public transportation systems to better serve existing customers by adjusting routes, travel times and stops to optimize service. New customers will also see advantages. Smart transportation systems will allow public transit to network with traffic signals and providers of ‘last-mile’ trips to minimize traffic disruption and inform decision making about modal (rail, bus, mobility-on-demand) planning and purchasing.” Sanjiv Das, a professor of data science and finance at Santa Clara University, responded, “AI will enhance search to create interactive reasoning and analytical systems. Search engines today do not know ‘why’ we want some information and hence cannot reason about it. They also do not interact with us to help with analysis. An AI system that collects information based on knowing why it is needed and then asks more questions to refine its search would be clearly available well before 2030. These ‘search-thinking bots’ will also write up analyses based on parameters elicited from conversation and imbue these analyses with different political (left/right) and linguistic (aggressive/mild) slants, chosen by the human, using advances in language generation, which are already well under way. These ‘intellectual’ agents will become companions, helping us make sense of our information overload. I often collect files of material on my cloud drive that I found '),\n",

It is unclear to me if I would need just one such agent, though it seems likely that different agents with diverse personalities may be more interesting! As always, we should worry what the availability of such agents might mean for normal human social interaction, but I can also see many advantages in freeing up time for socializing with other humans as well as enriched interactions, based on knowledge and science, assisted by our new intellectual companions.” Lawrence Roberts, designer and manager of ARPANET, the precursor to the internet and Internet Hall of Fame member, commented, “AI voice recognition, or text, with strong context understanding and response will allow vastly better access to website, program documentation, voice call answering, and all such interactions will greatly relieve user frustration with getting information. It will mostly provide service where no or little human support is being replaced as it is not available today in large part. For example, finding and/or doing a new or unused function of the program or website one is using. Visual, 3D-space-recognition AI to support better-than-human robot activity including vehicles, security surveillance, health scans and much more.” Christopher Yoo, a professor of law, communication and computer and information science at the University of Pennsylvania Law School, responded, “AI is good at carrying out tasks that follow repetitive patterns. In fact, AI is better than humans. Shifting these functions to machines will improve performance. It will also allow people to shift their efforts to high-value-added and more-rewarding directions, an increasingly critical consideration in developing world countries where population is declining. Research on human-computer interaction (HCI) also reveals that AI-driven pattern recognition will play a critical role in expanding humans’ ability to extend the benefits of computerization. HCI once held that our ability to gain the benefit from computers would be limited by the total amount of time people can spend sitting in front of a screen and inputting characters through a keyboard. The advent of AI-driven HCI will allow that to expand further and will reduce the amount of customization that people will have to program in by hand. At the same time, AI is merely a tool. All tools have their limits and can be misused. Even when humans are making the decisions instead of machines, blindly following the results of a protocol without exercising any judgment, can have disastrous results. Future applications of AI will thus likely involve both humans and machines if they are to fulfill their potential.” Joseph Konstan, distinguished professor of computer science specializing in human-computer interaction and AI at the University of Minnesota, predicted, “Widespread deployment of AI has immense potential to help in key areas that affect a large portion of the world's population, including agriculture, transportation (more efficiently getting food to people) and energy. Even as soon as 2030, I expect we’ll see substantial benefits for many who are today disadvantaged, \"),\n",

These additional observations add to the discussion of hopes and concerns about the future of human jobs. This segment starts with comments from those who are hopeful that the job situation and related social issues will turn out well. It is followed by statements from those who are pessimistic.  Respondents who were positive about the future of AI and work Bob Metcalfe, Internet Hall of Fame member, co-inventor of Ethernet, founder of 3Com and now professor of innovation and entrepreneurship at the University of Texas at Austin, said, “Pessimists are often right, but they never get anything done. All technologies come with problems, sure, but … generally, they get solved. The hardest problem I see is the evolution of work. Hard to figure out. Forty percent of us used to know how to milk cows, but now less than 1% do. We all used to tell elevator operators which floor we wanted, and now we press buttons. Most of us now drive cars and trucks and trains, but that’s on the verge of being over. AIs are most likely not going to kill jobs. They will handle parts of jobs, enhancing the productivity of their humans.” Stowe Boyd, founder and managing director at Work Futures, said, “There is a high possibility that unchecked expansion of AI could rapidly lead to widespread unemployment. My bet is that governments will step in to regulate the spread of AI, to slow the impacts of this phenomenon as a result of unrest by the mid 2020s. That regulation might include, for example, not allowing AIs to serve as managers of people in the workplace, but only to augment the work of people on a task or process level. So, we might see high degrees of automation in warehouses, but a human being would be ‘in charge’ in some sense. Likewise, fully autonomous freighters might be blocked by regulations.” An anonymous respondent wrote, “Repeatedly throughout history people have worried that new technologies would eliminate jobs. This has never happened, so I'm very skeptical it will this time. Having said that, there will be major short-term disruptions in the labor market and smart governments should begin to plan for this by considering changes to unemployment insurance, universal basic income, health insurance, etc. This is particularly the case in America, where so many benefits are tied to employment. I would say there is almost zero chance that the U.S. government will actually do this, so there will be a lot of pain and misery in the short and medium \"),\n",

Also, I think a lot of the projections on the use of AI are ridiculous. Regardless of the existence of the technology, cross-state shipping is not going to be taken over by automated trucks any time soon because of legal and ethical issues that have not been worked out.” Steven Miller, vice provost and professor of information systems at Singapore Management University, said, “It helps to have a sense of the history of technological change over the past few hundred years (even longer). Undoubtedly, new ways of using machines and new machine capabilities will be used to create economic activities and services that were either a) not previously possible, or b) previously too scarce and expensive, and now can be plentiful and inexpensive. This will create a lot of new activities and opportunities. At the same time, we know some existing tasks and jobs with a high proportion of those tasks will be increasingly automated. So we will simultaneously have both new opportunity creation as well as technological displacement. Even so, the long-term track record shows that human societies keep finding ways of creating more and more economically viable jobs. Cognitive automation will obviously enhance the realms of automation, but even with tremendous progress in this technology, there are and will continue to be limits. Humans have remarkable capabilities to deal with and adapt to change, so I do not see the ‘end of human work.’ The ways people and machines combine together will change – and there will be many new types of human-machine symbiosis. Those who understand this and learn to benefit from it will proposer.” Henry E. Brady, dean of the Goldman School of Public Policy at the University of California, Berkeley, wrote, “AI can replace people in jobs that require sophisticated and accurate pattern matching – driving, diagnoses based upon medical imaging, proofreading and other areas. There is also the fact that in the past technological change has mostly led to new kinds of jobs rather than the net elimination of jobs. Furthermore, I also believe that there may be limits to what AI can do. It is very good at pattern matching, but human intelligence goes far beyond pattern matching and it is not clear that computers will be able to compete with humans beyond pattern matching. It also seems clear that even the best algorithms will require constant human attention to update, check and revise them.” Geoff Livingston, author and futurist, commented, “The term AI misleads people. What we should call the trend is machine learning or algorithms. ‘Weak’ AI as it is called – today's AI – reduces repetitive tasks that most people find mundane. This in turn produces an opportunity to escape the trap of the proletariat, being forced into monotonous labor to earn a living. Instead of thinking of the ‘Terminator,’ we should view the current trend as an opportunity to seek out and embrace the tasks that we truly love, including more creative pursuits. If we embrace the inevitable evolution of technology to replace redundant tasks, we can encourage today’s youth to \"),\n",
              " Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/ai and the future of humans.pdf', 'page': 93}, page_content='93 PEW RESEARCH CENTER \\nwww.pewresearch.org \\npursue more creative and strategic pursuits. Further, today’s workers can learn how to manage machine learning or embrace training to pursue new careers that they may enjoy more. My fear is that many will simply reject change and blame technology, as has often been done. One could argue much of today’s populist uprising we are experiencing globally finds its roots in the current displacements caused by machine learning as typified by smart manufacturing. If so, the movement forward will be troublesome, rife with dark bends and turns that we may regret as cultures and countries.” Marek Havrda, director at NEOPAS and strategic adviser for the GoodAI project, a private research and development company based in Prague that focuses on the development of artificial general intelligence and AI applications, explained the issue from his point of view, “The development and implementation of artificial intelligence has brought about questions of the impact it will have on employment. Machines are beginning to fill jobs that have been traditionally reserved for humans, such as driving a car or prescribing medical treatment. How these trends may unfold is a crucial question. We may expect the emergence of ‘super-labour,’ a labour defined by super-high-added-value of human activity due to augmentation by AI. Apart from the ability to deploy AI, super-labour will be characterised by creativity and the ability to co-direct and supervise safe exploration of business opportunities together with perseverance in attaining defined goals. An example may be that by using various online, AI gig workers (and maybe several human gig workers), while leveraging AI to its maximum potential … at all aspects from product design to marketing and after-sales care, three people could create a new service and ensure its smooth delivery for which a medium-size company would be needed today. We can expect growing inequalities between those who have access and are able to use technology and those who do not. However, it seems more important how big a slice of the AI co-generated ‘pie’ is accessible to all citizens in absolute terms (e.g., having enough to finance public service and other public spending) which would make everyone better off than in pre-AI age, than the relative inequalities.” Yoram Kalman, an associate professor at the Open University of Israel and member of The Center for Internet Research at the University of Haifa, wrote, “In essence, technologies that empower people also improve their lives. I see that progress in the area of human-machine collaboration empowers people by improving their ability to communicate and to learn, and thus my optimism. I do not fear that these technologies will take the place of people, since history shows that again and again people used technologies to augment their abilities and to be more fulfilled. Although in the past, too, it seemed as if these technologies would leave people unemployed and useless, human ingenuity and the human spirit always found new challenges that could best be tackled by humans.” '),\n",

Davenport, distinguished professor of information technology and management at Babson College and fellow of the MIT Initiative on the Digital Economy, responded, “So far, most implementations of AI have resulted in some form of augmentation, not automation. Surveys of managers suggest that relatively few have automation-based job loss as the goal of their AI initiatives. So while I am sure there will be some marginal job loss, I expect that AI will free up workers to be more creative and to do more unstructured work.” Yvette Wohn, director of the Social Interaction Lab and expert on human-computer interaction at the New Jersey Institute of Technology, commented, “Artificial intelligence will be naturally integrated into our everyday lives. Even though people are concerned about computers replacing the jobs of humans the best-case scenario is that technology will be augmenting human capabilities and performing functions that humans do not like to do. Smart farms and connected distribution systems will hopefully eliminate urban food deserts and enable food production in areas not suited for agriculture. Artificial intelligence will also become better at connecting people and provide immediate support to people who are in crisis situations.” A principal architect for a major global technology company responded, “AI is a prerequisite to achieving a post-scarcity world, in which people can devote their lives to intellectual pursuits and leisure rather than to labor. The first step will be to reduce the amount of labor required for production of human necessities. Reducing tedium will require changes to the social fabric and economic relationships between people as the demand for labor shrinks below the supply, but if these challenges can be met then everyone will be better off.” Tom Hood, an expert in corporate accounting and finance, said, “By 2030, AI will stand for Augmented Intelligence and will play an ever-increasing role in working side-by-side with humans in all sectors to add its advanced and massive cognitive and learning capabilities to critical human domains like medicine, law, accounting, engineering and technology. Imagine a personal bot powered by artificial intelligence working by your side (in your laptop or smartphone) making recommendations on key topics by providing up-to-the-minute research or key pattern recognition and analysis of your organization’s data? One example is a CPA in tax given a complex global tax situation amid constantly changing tax laws in all jurisdictions who would be able to research and provide guidance on the most complex global issues in seconds. It is my hope for the future of artificial intelligence in 2030 that we will be augmenting our intelligence with these ‘machines.’” A professor of computer science expert in systems who works at a major U.S. technological university wrote, “By 2030, we should expect advances in AI, networking and other technologies enabled by AI and networks, e.g., the growing areas of persuasive and '),\n",

Many powerful technical tools today require detailed expertise, and AI can bring more of those to a larger swath of the population.” Respondents who have fears about AI’s impact on work  A section earlier in this report shared a number of key experts’ concerns about the potential negative impact of AI on the socioeconomic future if steps are not taken soon to begin to adjust to a future with far fewer jobs for humans. Many additional respondents to this canvassing shared fears about this. Wout de Natris, an internet cybercrime and security consultant based in Rotterdam, Netherlands, wrote, “Hope: Advancement in health care, education, decision-making, availability of information, higher standards in ICT-security, global cooperation on these issues, etc. Fear: Huge segments of society, especially the middle classes who carry society in most ways, e.g., through taxes, savings and purchases, will be rendered jobless through endless economic cuts by industry, followed by governments due to lower tax income. Hence all of society suffers. Can governments and industry refrain from an overkill of surveillance? Otherwise privacy values keep declining, leading to a lower quality of life.” Jonathan Taplin, director emeritus at the University of Southern California’s Annenberg Innovation Lab, wrote, “My fear is that the current political class is completely unprepared for the disruptions that AI and robotics applied at scale will bring to our economy. While techno-utopians point to universal basic income as a possible solution to wide-scale unemployment, there is no indication that anyone in politics has an appetite for such a solution. And because I believe that '),\n",

Blue-collar workers, people working in supermarkets stacking shelves, etc., will not be needed less, but the job market will not offer them any other possibilities. The gap between rich and poor will increase as the need for highly skilled and very well-paid people increases and the need for less skilled workers will decrease tremendously.” Ross Stapleton-Gray, principal at Stapleton-Gray and Associates, an information technology and policy consulting firm, commented, “Human-machine interaction could be for good or for ill. It will be hugely influenced by decisions on social priorities. We may be at a tipping point in recognizing that social inequities need to be addressed, so, say, a decreased need for human labor due to AI will result in more time for leisure, education, etc., instead of increasing wealth inequity.” Aneesh Aneesh, author of “Global Labor: Algocratic Modes of Organization” and professor at the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, responded, “Just as automation left large groups of working people behind even as the United States got wealthier as a country, it is quite likely that AI systems will automate the service sector in a similar way. Unless the welfare state returns with a vengeance, it is difficult to see the increased aggregate wealth resulting in any meaningful gains for the bottom half of society.” Alper Dincel of T.C. Istanbul Kultur University in Turkey, wrote, “Unqualified people won’t find jobs, as machines and programs take over easy work in the near future. Machines will also solve performance problems. There is no bright future for most people if we don’t start to try finding solutions.” Jason Abbott, professor and director at the Center for Asian Democracy at University of Louisville, said, “AI is likely to create significant challenges to the labor force as previously skilled (semi-skilled) jobs are replaced by AI – everything from AI in trucks and distribution to airlines, logistics and even medical records and diagnoses.” '),\n",

Fleischmann, an associate professor at the University of Texas at Austin’s School of Information, responded, “In corporate settings, I worry that AI will be used to replace human workers to a disproportionate extent, such that the net economic benefit of AI is positive, but that economic benefit is not distributed equally among individuals, with a smaller number of wealthy individuals worldwide prospering, and a larger number of less wealthy individuals worldwide suffering from fewer opportunities for gainful employment.” Gerry Ellis, founder and digital usability and accessibility consultant at Feel The BenefIT, responded, “Technology has always been far more quickly developed and adopted in the richer parts of the world than in the poorer regions where new technology is generally not affordable. AI cannot be taken as a stand-alone technology but in conjunction with other converging technologies like augmented reality, robotics, virtual reality, the Internet of Things, big data analysis, etc. It is estimated that around 80% of jobs that will be done in 2030 do not exist yet. One of the reasons why unskilled and particularly repetitive jobs migrate to poor countries is because of cheap labour costs, but AI combined with robotics will begin to do many of these jobs. For all of these reasons combined, the large proportion of the earth’s population that lives in the under-developed and developing world is likely to be left behind by technological developments. Unless the needs of people with disabilities are taken into account when designing AI related technologies, the same is true for them (or I should say ‘us,’ as I am blind).” Karen Oates, director of workforce development and financial stability for La Casa de Esperanza, commented, “Ongoing increases in the use of AI will not benefit the working poor and low-to-middle-income people. Having worked with these populations for 10 years I’ve already observed many of these people losing employment when robots and self-operating forklifts are implemented. Although there are opportunities to program and maintain these machines, realistically people who have the requisite knowledge and education will fill those roles. The majority of employers will be unwilling to invest the resources to train employees unless there is an economic incentive from the government to do so. Many lower-wage workers won’t have the confidence to return to school to develop new knowledge/skills when they were unsuccessful in the past. As the use of AI increases, low-wage workers will lose the small niche they hold in our economy.” Peggy Lahammer, director of health/life sciences at Robins Kaplan LLP and legal market analyst, commented, “Jobs will continue to change and as many disappear new ones will be created.

The interesting problem to solve will be the fact that initial designs of AI will come with built-in imaginaries of what ‘good’ or ‘correct’ constitutes. The level of flexibility designed in to allow for changes in normative perceptions and judgements will be key to ensuring that AI driven-systems support rather than obstruct productive social change.” Stephen McDowell, a professor of communication at Florida State University and expert in new media and internet governance, commented, “Much of our daily lives is made up of routines and habits that we repeat, and AI could assist in these practices. However, just because some things we do are repetitive does not mean they are insignificant. We draw a lot of meaning from things we do on a daily, weekly or annual basis, whether by ourselves or with others. Cultural practices such as cooking, shopping, cleaning, coordinating and telling stories are crucial parts of building our families and larger communities. Similarly, at work, some of the routines are predictable, but are also how we gain a sense of mastery and expertise in a specific domain. In both these examples, we will have to think about how we define knowledge, expertise, collaboration, and growth and development.” David Sarokin, author of “Missed Information: Better Information for Building a Wealthier, More Sustainable Future,” commented, “My biggest concern is that our educational system will not keep up with the demands of our modern times. It is doing a poor job of providing the foundations to our students. As more and more jobs are usurped by AI-endowed machines – everything from assembling cars to flipping burgers – those entering the workplace will need a level of technical sophistication that few graduates possess these days.” Justin Amyx, a technician with Comcast, said, “My worry is automation. Automation occurs usually with mundane tasks that fill low-paying, blue-collar-and-under jobs. Those jobs will disappear – lawn maintenance, truck drivers and fast food, to name a few. Those un-skilled or low-skilled workers will be jobless. Unless we have training programs to take care of worker displacement there will be issue.         '),\n",

They predict a rise in access to various tools, including digital agents that can perform rudimentary exams with no need to visit a clinic, a reduction in medical errors and better, faster recognition of risks and solutions. They also worry over the potential for a widening health care divide between those who can afford cutting-edge tools and treatments and those less privileged. They also express concerns about the potential for data abuses such as the denial of insurance or coverage or benefits for select people or procedures. Leonard Kleinrock, Internet Hall of Fame member and co-director of the first host-to-host online connection and professor of computer science at the University of California, Los Angeles, predicted, “As AI and machine learning improve, we will see highly customized interactions between humans and their health care needs. This mass customization will enable each human to have her medical history, DNA profile, drug allergies, genetic makeup, etc., always available to any caregiver/medical professional that they engage with, and this will be readily accessible to the individual as well. Their care will be tailored to their specific needs and the very latest advances will be able to be provided rapidly after the advances are established. The rapid provision of the best medical treatment will provide great benefits. In hospital settings, such customized information will dramatically reduce the occurrence of medical injuries and deaths due to medical errors. My hope and expectation is that intelligent agents will be able to assess the likely risks and the benefits that ensue from proposed treatments and procedures, far better than is done now by human evaluators, such humans, even experts, typically being poor decision makers in the face of uncertainty. But to bring this about, there will need to be carefully conducted tests and experimentation to assess the quality of the outcomes of AI-based decision making in this field. However, as with any ‘optimized’ system, one must continually be aware of the fragility of optimized systems when they are applied beyond the confines of their range of applicability.” Kenneth Grady, futurist, founding author of the Algorithmic Society blog and adjunct and advisor at the Michigan State University College of Law, responded, “In the next dozen years, AI will still be moving through a phase where it will augment what humans can do. It will help us sift through, organize and even evaluate the mountains of data we create each day. For example, doctors today still work with siloed data. Each patient’s vital signs, medicines, dosage rates, test results and side effects remain trapped in isolated systems. Doctors must evaluate this data without the benefit of knowing how it compares to the thousands of other patients around the country (or world) with similar problems. They struggle to turn the data into effective treatments '),\n",

As it evolves, AI will improve the process. Instead of episodic studies, doctors will have near-real-time access to information showing the effects of treatment regimes. Benefits and risks of drug interactions will be identified faster. Novel treatments will become evident more quickly.  Doctors will still manage the last mile, interpreting the analysis generated through AI. This human in the loop approach will remain critical during this phase. As powerful as AI will become, it still will not match humans on understanding how to integrate treatment with values. When will a family sacrifice effectiveness of treatment to prolong quality of life? When two life-threatening illnesses compete, which will the patient want treated first? This will be an important learning phase, as humans understand the limits of AI.” Charles Zheng, a researcher into machine learning and AI with the National Institute of Mental Health, commented, “In the year 2030, I expect AI will be more powerful than they currently are, but not yet at human level for most tasks. A patient checking into a hospital will be directed to the correct desk by a robot. The receptionist will be aided by software that listens to their conversation with the patient and automatically populates the information fields without needing the receptionist to type the information. Another program cross-references the database in the cloud to check for errors. The patient’s medical images would first be automatically labeled by a computer program before being sent to a radiologist.” A professor of computer science expert in systems who works at a major U.S. technological university wrote, “By 2030 … physiological monitoring devices (e.g., lower heartbeats and decreasing blood sugar levels) could indicate lower levels of physical alertness. Smart apps could detect those decaying physical conditions (at an individual level) and suggest improvements to the user (e.g., taking a coffee break with a snack). Granted, there may be large-scale problems caused by AI and robots, e.g., massive unemployment, but the recent trends seem to indicate small improvements such as health monitor apps outlined above, would be more easily developed and deployed successfully.” Kenneth Cukier, author and senior editor at The Economist, commented, “AI will be making more decisions in life, and some people will be uneasy with that. But these are decisions that are more effectively done by machines, such as assessing insurance risk, the propensity to repay a loan or to survive a disease. A good example is health care: Algorithms, not doctors, will be diagnosing many diseases, even if human doctors are still ‘in the loop.’ The benefit is that healthcare can reach down to populations that are today underserved: the poor and rural worldwide.” '),\n",

There are so many moving parts and components to understanding health care needs and deciding how to proceed in treatment and prevention. With AI, we can program algorithms to help refine those decision-making processes, but only when we train the AI tools on human thinking, a tremendous amount of real data and actual circumstances and experiences. There are some contexts in which human bias and emotion can be detrimental to decision-making. For example, breast cancer is over-diagnosed and over-treated. While mammography guidelines have changed to try to reflect this reality, strong human emotion powered by anecdotal experience leaves some practitioners unwilling to change their recommendations based on evidence and advocacy groups reluctant to change their stance based on public outcry. Perhaps there is an opportunity for AI to calculate a more specific risk for each individual person, allowing for a tailored experience amid the broader guidelines. If screening guidelines change to ‘recommended based on individual risk,’ it lessens the burden on both the care provider and the individual. People still have to make their own decisions, but they may be able to do so with more information and a greater understanding of their own risk and reward. This is such a low-tech and simple example of AI, but one in which AI can – importantly – supplement human decision-making without replacing it.” Angelique Hedberg, senior corporate strategy analyst at RTI International, said, “The greatest advancements and achievements will be in health – physical, mental and environmental. The improvements will have positive trickle-down impacts on education, work, gender equality and reduced inequality. AI will redefine our understanding of health care, optimizing existing processes while simultaneously redefining how we answer questions about what it means to be healthy, bringing care earlier in the cycle due to advances in diagnostics and assessment, i.e. in the future preventative care identifies and initiates treatment for illness before symptoms present. The advances will not be constrained to humans; they will include animals and the built environment. This will happen across the disease spectrum. Advanced ‘omics’ will empower better decisions. There will be a push and a pull by the market and individuals. This is a global story, with fragmented and discontinuous moves being played out over the next decade as we witness wildly different experiments in health across the globe. This future is full of hope for individuals and communities. My greatest hope is for disabled individuals and those currently living with disabilities. I’m excited for communities and interpersonal connections as the work in this future will allow for and increase the value of the human-to-human experiences. Progress is often only '),\n",

Doctors cannot recall all the possibilities; they have problems correlating all the symptoms and recognizing the patterns. I hope that in the future patients will be interviewed by computers, which will correlate the described symptoms with results of tests. I hope that with the further development of AI and cognitive computing there will be fewer errors in reports of medical imaging and diagnosis.” Eduardo Vendrell, a computer science professor at the Polytechnic University of Valencia in Spain, responded, “In the field of health, many solutions will appear that will allow us to anticipate current problems and discover other risk situations more efficiently. The use of personal gadgets and other domestic devices will allow interacting directly with professionals and institutions in any situation of danger or deterioration of our health.” Monica Murero, director of the E-Life International Institute and associate professor in sociology of new technology at the University of Naples Federico II in Italy, commented, “In health care, I foresee positive outcomes in terms of reducing human mistakes, that are currently still creating several failures. Also, I foresee an increased development of mobile (remote) 24/7 health care services and personalized medicine thanks to AI and human-machine collaboration applied to the field.” Uta Russmann, professor in the department of communication at FHWien der WKW University of Applied Sciences for Management & Communication, said, “Life expectancy is increasing (globally) and human-machine/AI collaboration will help older people to manage their life on their own by taking care of them, helping them in the household (taking down the garbage, cleaning up, etc.) as well as keeping them company – just like cats and dogs do, but it will be a much more ‘advanced’ interaction.” Lindsey Andersen, an activist at the intersection of human rights and technology for Freedom House and Internews, now doing graduate research at Princeton University, commented, “AI will augment human intelligence. In health care, for example, it will help doctors more accurately diagnose and treat disease and continually monitor high-risk patients through internet-connected medical devices. It will bring health care to places with a shortage of doctors, allowing health care workers to diagnose and treat disease anywhere in the world and to prevent disease outbreaks before they start.” '),\n",

Personal assistants are already capable of many important tasks to help make sure older adults stay in their home. But adding to that emotion detection, more in-depth health monitoring and AI-based diagnostics will surely enhance the power of these tools.” Denis Parra, assistant professor of computer science in the school of engineering at the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile Chile, commented, “I live in a developing country. Whilst there are potential negative aspects of AI (loss of jobs), for people with disabilities AI technology could improve their lives. I imagine people entering a government office or health facility where people with eye- or ear-related disabilities could effortlessly interact to state their necessities and resolve their information needs.” Timothy Leffel, research scientist, National Opinion Research Center (NORC) at the University of Chicago, said, “Formulaic transactions and interactions are particularly ripe for automation. This can be good in cases where human error can cause problems, e.g., for well-understood diagnostic medical testing.” Jean-Daniel Fekete, researcher in human-computer interaction at INRIA in France, said, “Humans and machines will integrate more, improving health through monitoring and easing via machine control. Personal data will then become even more revealing and intrusive and should be kept under personal control.” Joe Whittaker, a former professor of sciences and associate director of the NASA GESTAR program, now associate provost at Jackson State University, responded, “My hope is that AI/human-machine interface will become commonplace especially in the academic research and health care arena. I envision significant advances in brain-machine interface to facilitate mitigation of physical and mental challenges. Similar uses in robotics should also be used to assist the elderly.” James Gannon, global head of eCompliance for emerging technology, cloud and cybersecurity at Novartis, responded, “AI will increase the speed and availability to develop drugs and therapies for orphan indications. AI will assist in general lifestyle and health care management for the average person.” Jay Sanders, president and CEO of the Global Telemedicine Group, responded, “AI will bring collective expertise to the decision point, and in health care, bringing collective expertise to the bedside will save many lives now lost by individual medical errors.” '),\n",

AI will provide better data-driven diagnoses of medical and cognitive issues and it will facilitate affordable AV-based paratransit for the less mobile. It will support, not replace, human care-givers.” John Lazzaro, retired professor of electrical engineering and computer science, University of California, Berkeley, commented, “When I visit my primary care physician today, she spends a fair amount time typing into an EMS application as she’s talking to me. In this sense, the computer has already arrived in the clinic. An AI system that frees her from this clerical task – that can listen and watch and distill the doctor-patient interaction into actionable data – would be an improvement. A more-advanced AI system would be able to form a ‘second opinion’ based on this data as the appointment unfolds, discreetly advising the doctor via a wearable. The end goal is a reduction in the number of ‘false starts’ in-patient diagnosis. If you've read Lisa Sander’s columns in the New York Times, where she traces the arc of difficult diagnoses, you understand the real clinical problem that this system addresses.” Steve Farnsworth, chief marketing officer at Demand Marketing, commented, “Machine learning and AI offer tools to turn that into actionable data. One project using machine learning and big data already was able to predict SIDS correctly 94% of the time. Imagine AI looking at diagnostics, tests and successful treatments of millions of medical cases. We would instantly have a deluge of new cures and know the most effective treatment options using only the data, medicines and therapies we have now. The jump in quality health care alone for humans is staggering. This is only one application for AI.” Daniel Siewiorek, a professor with the Human-Computer Interaction Institute at Carnegie Mellon University, predicted, “AI will enable systems to perform labor-intensive activities where there are labor shortages. For example, consider recovery from an injury. There is a shortage of physical therapists to monitor and correct exercises. AI would enable a virtual coach to monitor, correct and encourage a patient. Virtual coaches could take on the persona of a human companion or a pet, allowing the aging population to live independently.” Joly MacFie, president of the Internet Society, New York chapter, commented, “AI will have many benefits for people with disabilities and health issues.

Craig Burdett, a respondent who provided no identifying details, wrote, “While most AI will probably be a positive benefit, the possible darker side of AI could lead to a loss of agency for some. For example, in a health care setting an increasing use of AI could allow wealthier patients access to significantly-more-advanced diagnosis agents. When coupled with a supportive care team, these patients could receive better treatment and a greater range of treatment options. Conversely, less-affluent patients may be relegated to automated diagnoses and treatment plants with little opportunity for interaction to explore alternative treatments. AI could, effectively, manage long-term health care costs by offering lesser treatment (and sub-optimal recovery rates) to individuals perceived to have a lower status. Consider two patients with diabetes. One patient, upon diagnosis, modifies their eating and exercise patterns (borne out by embedded diagnostic tools) and would benefit from more advanced treatment. The second patient fails to modify their behaviour resulting in substantial ongoing treatment that could be avoided by simple lifestyle choices. An AI could subjectively evaluate that the patient has little interest in their own health and withhold more expensive treatment options leading to a shorter lifespan and an overall cost saving.” Sumandra Majee, an architect at F5 Networks Inc., said, “AI, deep learning, etc., will become more a part of daily life in advanced countries. This will potentially widen the gap between technology-savvy people and economically well-to-do folks and the folks with limited access to technology. However, I am hopeful that in the field of healthcare, especially when it comes to diagnosis, AI will significantly augment the field, allowing doctors to do a far better job. Many of the routines aspects of checkups can be done via technology. There is no reason an expert human has to be involved in basic A/B testing to reach a conclusion. Machines can be implemented for those tasks and human doctors should only do the critical parts. I do see AI playing a negative role in education, where students may not often actually do the hard work of learning through experience. It might actually make the overall population dumber.” Timothy Graham, a postdoctoral research fellow in sociology and computer science at Australian National University, commented, “In health care, we see current systems already under heavy criticism (e.g., the My Health Record system in Australia, or the NHS Digital program), because they are nudging citizens into using the system through an ‘opt-out’ mechanism and there are concerns that those who do not opt out may be profiled, targeted and/or denied access to services based on their own data.” '),\n",

Will a hologram or a computer deliver ‘the bad news’ instead of a physician? Given the health care industry’s inherent profit motives it would be easy for them to justify how much cheaper it would be to simply have devices diagnose, prescribe treatment and do patient care, without concern for the importance of human touch and interactions. Thus, we may devolve into a health care system where the rich actually get a human doctor while everyone else, or at least the poor and uninsured, get the robot.” The following one-liners from anonymous respondents also tie into the future of health care: § “People could use a virtual doctor for information and first-level response; so much time could be saved!”  § “The merging of data science and AI could benefit strategic planning of the future research and development efforts that should be undertaken by humanity.” § “I see economic efficiencies and advances in preventive medicine and treatment of disease, however, I do think there will be plenty of adverse consequences.” § “Data can reduce errors – for instance, in clearly taking into account the side effects of a medicine or use of multiple medications.” § “Human-machine/AI collaboration will reduce barriers to proper medical treatment through better recordkeeping and preventative measures.” § “AI can take over many of the administrative tasks current doctors must do, allowing them more time with patients.” The future of education:  High hopes for advances in adaptive and individualized learning, but some doubt that there will be any significant progress and worry over digital divide Over the past few decades, experts and amateurs alike have predicted the internet would have large-scale impacts on education. Many of these hopes have not lived up to the hype. Some respondents to this canvassing said the advent of AI could foster those changes. They expect to see more options for affordable adaptive and individualized learning solutions, including digital agents or “AI assistants” that work to enhance student-teacher interactions and effectiveness.

Connect and assimilate becomes the new learning model.” Lou Gross, professor of mathematical ecology and expert in grid computing, spatial optimization and modeling of ecological systems at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, said, “I see AI as assisting in individualized instruction and training in ways that are currently unavailable or too expensive. There are hosts of school systems around the world that have some technology but are using it in very constrained ways. AI use will provide better adaptive learning and help achieve a teacher’s goal of personalizing education based on each student’s progress.” Guy Levi, chief innovation officer for the Center for Educational Technology, based in Israel, wrote, “In the field of education AI will promote personalization, which almost by definition promotes motivation. The ability to move learning forward all the time by a personal AI assistant, which opens the learning to new paths, is a game changer. The AI assistants will also communicate with one another and will orchestrate teamwork and collaboration. The AI assistants will also be able to manage diverse methods of learning, such as productive failure, teach-back and other innovating pedagogies.” Micah Altman, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and head scientist in the program on information science at MIT Libraries, wrote, “These technologies will help to adapt learning (and other environments) to the needs of each individual by translating language, aiding memory and providing us feedback on our own emotional and cognitive state and on the environment. We all need adaptation; each of us, practically every day, is at times tired, distracted, fuzzy-headed or nervous, which limits how we learn, how we understand and how we interact with others. AI has the potential to assist us to engage with the world better – even when conditions are not ideal – and to better understand ourselves.” Shigeki Goto, Asia-Pacific internet pioneer, Internet Hall of Fame member and a professor of computer science at Waseda University, commented, “AI is already applied to personalized medicine for an individual patient. Similarly, it will be applied to learning or education to realize ‘personalized learning’ or tailored education. We need to collect data which covers both of successful learning and failure experiences, because machine learning requires positive and negative data.” Andreas Kirsch, fellow at Newspeak House, formerly with Google and DeepMind in Zurich and London, wrote, “Higher education outside of normal academia will benefit further from AI progress and empower more people with access to knowledge and information.

At the same time, child labor will be reduced because robots will be able to perform the tasks far cheaper and faster, forcing governments in Asia to find real solutions.” Kristin Jenkins, executive director of BioQUEST Curriculum Consortium, said, “One of the benefits of this technology is the potential to have really effective, responsive education resources. We know that students benefit from immediate feedback and the opportunity to practice applying new information repeatedly to enhance mastery. AI systems are perfect for analyzing students’ progress, providing more practice where needed and moving on to new material when students are ready. This allows time with instructors to focus on more-complex learning, including 21st-century skills.” Mike Meyer, chief information officer at Honolulu Community College, commented, “Adult education availability and relevance will undergo a major transformation. Community colleges will become more directly community centers for both occupational training and greatly expanded optional liberal arts, art, crafts and hobbies. Classes will, by 2030, be predominantly augmented-reality-based, with a full mix of physical and virtual students in classes presented in virtual classrooms by national and international universities and organizations. The driving need will be expansion of knowledge for personal interest and enjoyment as universal basic income or equity will replace the automated tasks that had provided subsistence jobs in the old system.” Jennifer Groff, co-founder of the Center for Curriculum Redesign, an international non-governmental organization dedicated to redesigning education for the 21st century, wrote, “The impact on learning and learning environments has the potential to be one of the most positive future outcomes. Learning is largely intangible and invisible, making it a ‘black box’ – and our tools to capture and support learning to this point have been archaic. Think large-scale assessment. Learners need tools that help them understand where they are in a learning pathway, how they learn best, what they need next and so on. We're only just beginning to use technology to better answer these questions. AI has the potential to help us better understand learning, gain insights into learners at scale and, ultimately, build better learning tools and systems for them. But as a large social system, it is also prey to the complications of poor public policy that ultimately warps and diminishes AI’s potential positive impact.” Norton Gusky, an education-technology consultant, wrote, “By 2030 most learners will have personal profiles that will tap into AI/machine learning. Learning will happen everywhere and at any time. There will be appropriate filters that will limit the influence of AI, but ethical considerations will also be an issue.”  \"),\n",

Education, to me, has always been the status leveler, correcting, to some extent, for birth luck and social mobility. This will be like Asimov’s ‘Foundation,’ where everyone is plugged into the data-sphere. There is a dark side (later) but overall a positive.” However, some expect that there will be a continuing digital divide in education, with the privileged having more access to advanced tools and more capacity for using them well, while the less-privileged lag behind. Henning Schulzrinne, co-chair of the Internet Technical Committee of the IEEE Communications Society, professor at Columbia University and Internet Hall of Fame member, said, “Human-mediated education will become a luxury good. Some high school- and college-level teaching will be conducted partially by video and AI-graded assignments, using similar platforms to the MOOC [massive open online courses] models today, with no human involvement, to deal with increasing costs for education (‘robo-TA’).” Joe Whittaker, a former professor of sciences and associate director of the NASA GESTAR program, now associate provost at Jackson State University, responded, “Huge segments of society will be left behind or excluded completely from the benefits of digital advances – many persons in underserved communities as well as others who are socio-economically challenged. This is due to the fact that these persons will be under-prepared generally, with little or no digital training or knowledge base. They rarely have access to the relatively ubiquitous internet, except when at school or in the workplace. Clearly, the children of these persons will be greatly disadvantaged.” Some witnesses of technology’s evolution over the past few decades feel that its most-positive potential has been disappointingly delayed. After witnessing the slower-than-expected progress of tech’s impact on public education since the 1990s, they are less hopeful than others. Ed Lyell, longtime educational technologies expert and professor at Adams State University, said education has been held back to this point by the tyranny of the status quo. He wrote, “By 2030, lifelong learning will become more widespread for all ages. The tools already exist, including Khan Academy and YouTube. We don’t have to know as much, just how to find information when we want it. We will have on-demand, 24/7 ‘schooling.’ This will make going to sit-down classroom schools more and more a hindrance to our learning. The biggest negative will be from those protecting current, status-quo education including teachers/faculty, school boards and college administrators.

Part of the problem now is that they do not want to acknowledge the reality of how current schools are today. Some do a good job, yet these are mostly serving already smarter, higher-income communities. Parents fight to have their children have a school like they experienced, forgetting how inefficient and often useless it was. AI can help customize curricula to each learner and guide/monitor their journey through multiple learning activities, including some existing schools, on-the-job learning, competency-based learning, internships and such. You can already learn much more, and more efficiently, using online resources than almost all of the classes I took in my public schooling and college, all the way through getting a Ph.D.” A consultant and analyst also said that advances in education have been held back by entrenched interests in legacy education systems, writing, “The use of technology in education is minimal today due to the existence and persistence of the classroom-in-a-school model. As we have seen over the last 30 years, the application of artificial intelligence in the field of man/machine interface has grown in many unexpected directions. Who would have thought back in the late 1970s that the breadth of today’s online (i.e., internet) capabilities could emerged? I believe we are just seeing the beginning of the benefits of the man/machine interface for mankind. The institutionalized education model must be eliminated to allow education of each and every individual to grow. The human brain can be ‘educated’ 24 hours a day by intelligent ‘educators’ who may not even be human in the future. Access to information is no longer a barrier as it was 50 years ago. The next step now is to remove the barrier of structured human delivery of learning in the classroom.” Brock Hinzmann, a partner in the Business Futures Network who worked for 40 years as a futures researcher at SRI International, was hopeful in his comments but also issued a serious warning. He wrote: “Most of the improvements in the technologies we call AI will involve machine learning from big data to improve the efficiency of systems, which will improve the economy and wealth. It will improve emotion and intention recognition, augment human senses and improve overall satisfaction in human-computer interfaces. There will also be abuses in monitoring personal data and emotions and in controlling human behavior, which we need to recognize early and thwart. Intelligent machines will recognize patterns that lead to equipment failures or flaws in final products and be able to correct a condition or shut down and pinpoint the problem. Autonomous vehicles will be able to analyze data from other vehicles and sensors in the roads or on the people nearby to recognize changing conditions and avoid accidents. In education and training, AI learning systems will recognize learning preferences, styles and progress of individuals and help direct them toward a personally satisfying outcome.  '),\n",

This is the 10th Future of the Internet study the two organizations have conducted together. For this project, we invited more than 10,000 experts and members of the interested public to share their opinions on the likely future of the internet, and 985 responded to at least one of the questions we asked. This report covers only the answers to our questions about AI and the future of humans. We also asked respondents to answer a series of questions tied to the 50th anniversary of the ARPANET/internet; additional reports tied to those responses will be released in 2019, the anniversary year. Specifically related to artificial intelligence, the participants in the nonscientific canvassing were asked:  “Please think forward to the year 2030. Analysts expect that people will become even more dependent on networked artificial intelligence (AI) in complex digital systems. Some say we will continue on the historic arc of augmenting our lives with mostly positive results as we widely implement these networked tools. Some say our increasing dependence on these AI and related systems is likely to lead to widespread difficulties.  Our question: By 2030, do you think it is most likely that advancing AI and related technology systems will enhance human capacities and empower them? That is, most of the time, will most people be better off than they are today? Or is it most likely that advancing AI and related technology systems will lessen human autonomy and agency to such an extent that most people will not be better off than the way things are today?” The answers of the 979 respondents include:   • 63% who said most people will be better off • 37% who said most people will not be better off  • 25 respondents who chose not to select either option     '),\n",

Please consider giving an example of how a typical human-machine interaction will look and feel in a specific area, for instance, in the workplace, in family life, in a health care setting or in a learning environment. Why? What is your hope or fear? What actions might be taken to assure the best future?” The web-based instrument was first sent directly to a list of targeted experts identified and accumulated by Pew Research Center and Elon University during previous “Future of the Internet” studies, as well as those identified in an earlier study of people who made predictions about the likely future of the internet between 1990 to 1995. Additional experts with proven interest in this particular research topic were also added to the list. Among those invited were artificial intelligence researchers, developers and business leaders from leading global organizations, including, to name a few, Oxford, Cambridge, MIT, Stanford and Carnegie Mellon universities, Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Amazon, Kernel, Kyndi, BT and Cloudflare; leaders active in global internet governance and internet research activities, such as the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), Internet Society (ISOC), International Telecommunications Union (ITU), Association of Internet Researchers (AoIR), and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). We also invited a large number of professionals and policy people working in government, including the National Science Foundation, Federal Communications Commission, U.S. military and European Union; think tanks and interest networks (for instance, those that include professionals and academics in anthropology, sociology, psychology, law, political science and communications); engineering/computer science and business/entrepreneurship faculty, graduate students and postgraduate researchers who have published work tied to these topics; plus many who are active in civil society organizations such as Association for Progressive Communications (APC), Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC), Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and Access Now; and those affiliated with newly emerging nonprofits and other research units. Invitees were encouraged to share the survey link with others they believed would have an interest in participating, thus there was a small “snowball” effect as a small percentage of these invitees invited others to weigh in. Since the data are based on a nonrandom sample, the results are not projectable to any population other than the individuals expressing their points of view in this sample.  '),\n",

About half of the expert respondents elected to remain anonymous. Because people’s level of expertise is an important element of their participation in the conversation, anonymous respondents were given the opportunity to share a description of their internet expertise or background and this was noted where relevant in this report.  Some 519 respondents answered the demographic questions on the canvassing. About 70% identified themselves as being based in North America, while 30% hail from other corners of the world. When asked about their “primary area of internet interest,” 33% identified themselves as professor/teacher; 17% as research scientists; 13% as futurists or consultants; 8% as technology developers or administrators; 5% as entrepreneurs or business leaders; 5% as advocates or activist users; 4% as pioneers or originators; 1% as legislators, politicians or lawyers; and an additional 13% specified their primary area of interest as “other.” Following is a list of some of the key respondents in this canvassing:  Walid Al-Saqaf, senior lecturer at Sodertorn University, Sweden, and member of the board of trustees of the Internet Society (ISOC); Aneesh Aneesh, author of “Global Labor: Algocratic Modes of Organization”; Kostas Alexandridis, author of “Exploring Complex Dynamics in Multi-agent-based Intelligent Systems”; Micah Altman, director of research and head scientist for the program on information science at MIT; Geoff Arnold, CTO for the Verizon Smart Communities organization; Rob Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation; Collin Baker, senior AI researcher at the International Computer Science Institute at the University of California, Berkeley; Brian Behlendorf, executive director of the Hyperledger project at The Linux Foundation; Nathaniel Borenstein, chief scientist at Mimecast; danah boyd, founder and president of the Data & Society Research Institute, and principal researcher at Microsoft; Stowe Boyd, founder and managing director at Work Futures; Henry E.

It is challenging to conceptually capture and empirically measure both benefits and downsides. We \\ntherefore provide an account of the findings and implications of a multi-dimensional study of AI, comprising 10 \\ncase studies, five scenarios, an ethical impact analysis of AI, a human rights analysis of AI and a technical analysis \\nof known and potential threats and vulnerabilities. Based on our findings, we separate AI ethics discourse into \\nthree streams: (1) specific issues related to the application of machine learning, (2) social and political questions \\narising in a digitally enabled society and (3) metaphysical questions about the nature of reality and humanity. \\nHuman rights principles and legislation have a key role to play in addressing the ethics of AI. This work helps to \\nsteer AI to contribute to human flourishing.   \\n1. Introduction \\nThe development of artificial intelligence (AI) is often described in \\nterms of human progress. The recent progress of machine learning, \\nsupported by growing amounts of available data combined with rapidly \\nexpanding computing capabilities and publicly available tools and li -\\nbraries, have led to expectations of increased efficiency but also to new \\nand better services for consumers and citizens. This broadly positive \\ndiscourse is, however, counterbalanced by a discussion of the downsides \\nand risks of AI. \\nThe ethics of AI is a topic of conversation in the disciplines concerned \\nwith these technologies including the social sciences, humanities, media \\nand policy. Worries range from discrimination due to biased datasets to \\nthe domination of humanity by sentient machines. The social impact of \\nAI-based technologies provides the backdrop and justification for the \\nflurry of activities in public discourse and policy developments about \\nwhether and how AI should be regulated or whether other ways should \\nbe found to address the downsides of AI. \\nA growing volume of literature suggests that governance mecha -\\nnisms need to be devised for these technologies because existing \\ngovernance structures are not able to address the issues they raise. As a \\nconsequence, one can find numerous suggestions on various ways to \\ndevelop governance structures that range from the informal, such as \\nvoluntary industry codes of conduct, to national and international \\nlegislation and the creation of regulators. \\nOne weakness of the current discourse is a disconnect between \\nrigorous academic research on the content and implications of these \\ntechnologies and the development of governance proposals. \\nIn order to move beyond the current discourse, gain a deeper un -\\nderstanding of the nature of ethics in AI, and allow for a critical \\nreflection of the current discourse, we conducted multi-method and \\ninterdisciplinary research aimed at contributing to empirical and \\n* Corresponding author at: De Montfort University, The Gateway, Leicester LE2 9BH, UK. \\nE-mail address: bstahl@dmu.ac.uk (B.C.

The aim of this paper is to contribute to the discussion \\nabout how to identify, interpret and address ethical issues arising from \\nAI applications\\n1\\n. The paper critically reflects on the term AI and explores \\nwhich aspects of AI raise which types of issues and how these are re -\\nflected and addressed in organisational and societal practice. Bringing \\ntogether conceptual insights and empirical findings, the paper is in a \\nposition to propose new ways to think about AI and structure the AI \\nethics narrative. In order to achieve this aim, the paper first seeks to \\nanswer the question of what precisely are the key ethical issues and how \\nbest to classify or categorise them. It then explores how existing \\ngovernance mechanisms may be applied to these issues. This leads to the \\nfinal question of theoretical and practical next steps. \\nOur analysis shows that the ethical issues that arise in empirical \\nobservations are similar to those that the academic literature discusses, \\nwhich provides reason for the belief that the discourse on ethics in AI is \\nreasonably expansive. At the same time, however, it becomes clear that \\nthe meaning of these issues is largely context-dependent. We use our \\nunderstanding of the ethical issues to categorise them into three broad \\ncategories: (1) issues directly related to machine learning, (2) broader \\nsocial and political issues arising in modern digitally enabled societies \\nand finally (3) metaphysical questions. These categories allow us to map \\ncurrently existing and discussed mitigation and governance structures to \\nthese issues. This is an important starting point for the practical question \\nof what can and should be done to address these issues. This question is \\nbeyond the scope of this paper. \\nThe findings presented in this paper are important in several re -\\nspects. The paper makes an academic contribution to the quickly \\nspreading discussion of ethics and AI and research around ethics, values, \\ngovernance and tools of AI. The categorisation of issues suggested here \\nand the mapping of the categories to different governance mechanisms \\ncan help streamline the debate. Due to the high practical importance of \\nthe underlying technologies, the paper also has practical importance for \\nstakeholders faced with the practical challenge of proactively engaging \\nwith the ethics of AI. The paper can help organisations developing, \\ndeploying or using AI to identify issues they are likely to face and engage \\nwith governance mechanisms that can address these issues. \\nIn order to develop the argument, the paper proceeds as follows. In \\nthe next section, we discuss the governance of AI, looking first at defi -\\nnitions, followed by a discussion of ethical issues and currently proposed \\ngovernance structures. We then describe our multi-dimensional empir -\\nical study of AI. The findings and discussion give rise to our catego -\\nrisation of issues, which we then map to governance structures and \\nstakeholders. Our discussion and conclusions demonstrate the novelty \\nand relevance of our findings while we propose next steps. \\n2. Governance of AI \\nThis section provides the conceptual basis of tthis article and gives an \\noverview of current discussions regarding AI, its ethical implications and \\npossible governance structures. The term ’governance’ as developed in \\npolitical sciences traditionally refers to alternatives to formal govern -\\nment on a societal or state level. In business research, it frequently refers \\nto structures and processes within organisations, whereas on a higher \\nlevel the term ’regulation’ is used (Braithwaite & Drahos, 2000). How -\\never, ’governance’ is increasingly used to describe a much broader array \\nof “[…] processes of governing, whether undertaken by a government, \\nmarket, or network, whether over a family, tribe, formal or informal \\norganization, or territory, and whether through laws, norms, power, or \\nlanguage” (Bevir, 2012, p. 1). The term also refers to specific localised \\nways of organising (or governing) particular issues, as in data gover -\\nnance (Khatri & Brown, 2010) or information governance (ISO, 2008), \\nrendering it suitable to describe ways of dealing with AI that cover many \\nsocietal actors and activities. \\n2.1. AI and big data \\nThe concept of AI, while much discussed, is not well defined. A \\ntypical definition of AI is the one provided by the European Commission \\n(2018, p. 1): “Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to systems that display \\nintelligent behaviour by analysing their environment and taking actions \\n– with some degree of autonomy – to achieve specific goals.” This is \\nconsistent with Haenlein and Kaplan (2019) emphasis on the interpre -\\ntation of external data, learning from such data and using data for the \\nachievement of specific goals. While such definitions are sufficient to \\ngive an idea of the scope of AI, they are arguably not specific enough to \\nallow the identification of specific ethical issues or the application of \\ngovernance structures. Definitions such as the EC’s can also be prob -\\nlematic when they seem to imply contentious positions, such as that AI \\ncan behave, analyse and act, which can be read as imputing character -\\nistics, notably that of independent agency, that current machine \\nlearning technologies do not display. This points to metaphysical as -\\nsumptions about AI to which we return to below. \\nOne reason for these shortcomings is that the definitions hide the \\nimmense breadth and depth of the underlying AI research (Elsevier, \\n2018). The current prominence of AI is based on long-established \\nprinciples of machine learning, often implemented through (deep) \\nneural networks. These have recently gained prominence due to the \\nincreased availability of computing power and large data sets for \\ntraining purposes. Ethical discussions of AI therefore need to be sensitive \\nto both the consequences of the application of AI algorithms and tech -\\nniques as well as the ethical aspects of (big) data analytics (B. D. Mit -\\ntelstadt, Allo, Taddeo, Wachter, & Floridi, 2016; Nerurkar, Wadephul, & \\nWiegerling, 2016; Varley-Winter & Shah, 2016). Public discourse on AI \\nespecially focuses on machine learning and the empirical work we have \\nundertaken covers technologies in machine learning and big data ana -\\nlytics. However, as we argue below, the ethics of AI debate is broader \\nthan this and refers to other concepts of AI, notably that AI technologies \\nhave broader human-like cognitive abilities. The concept of general AI \\ngoes back to the beginning of AI research and is sometimes referred to as \\nGood Old Fashioned AI (GOFAI) (Moor & Bynum, 2002). General AI \\ntechnologies do not currently exist, but they figure strongly in the public \\ndiscourse. In order to be able to make sense of the broader debate, it is \\nimportant to be aware of the entire breadth of meaning of the term. \\nThis paper therefore does not attempt to offer a comprehensive \\ndefinition of AI or of any of its constituent technologies such as machine \\nlearning. Instead, it aims to bring greater clarity to the question what \\npeople refer to when they talk about AI and, more importantly, when \\nthey talk about the ethics of AI or about the ethical issues of AI. These \\nconceptual questions are crucial to dealing with the ethics of AI and \\nquestions of governance. They pose the problem of delineating which \\nethical issues are related to or caused by AI and it complicates questions \\nof governance, where the application area of governance mechanisms is \\noften not clear, as we will show in more detail below. \\n2.2. Ethics and AI \\nThe concept of ethics is even more contested and open than that of \\nAI. In everyday English, it denotes questions of right or wrong, of good \\nor bad. Following Stahl (2012), we argue that this everyday under -\\nstanding of ethics constitutes the basis of explicit reasoning and aca -\\ndemic reflection, which are the subject matter of philosophical ethics. \\nAnswering the question of why a particular action can be seen as good or \\nbad or which processes would allow answering such a question is the \\n1 \\nWe use the term \"issue\" in an open sense, accepting as issues whatever our \\nrespondents or the literature describes using the term. As a consequence, the \\nissues we cover vary greatly in terms of scope and impact. Some are very \\nprecise and focused whereas other are large and fuzzy and cover entire areas \\nwhere issues arise. \\nB.C.

These include classical theories \\nsuch as virtue ethics ( Aristotle, 2007 ) which determines the ethics \\nquality often action based on the character of the individual undertaking \\nit. Other frequently used ethical theories include deontology, which \\nfocuses on the agent ’ s duty ( Kant, 1788, 1797 ), or teleology which looks \\nat the consequences and outcomes of an action to determine its ethical \\nstatus ( Mill, 1861 ). In addition to these well-established traditional \\nethical theories, there are more recent ones like the ethics of care ( Adam, \\n2001; Gilligan, 1990 ) and specific ethical theories aimed at technolog -\\nical applications, such as computer ethics (Terrell Ward Bynum & \\nRogerson, 2003 ; D. G. Johnson, 2001 ), information ethics ( Capurro, \\n2006 ; L. Floridi, 1999 ; Luciano Floridi, 2010 ) or disclosive ethics ( Brey, \\n2000 ). \\nDespite a rich history of discussing the relative merits of various \\nethical positions, the current discourse around ethical issues of AI makes \\nlittle reference to philosophical ethical theories. Instead, the generally \\naccepted approach to AI ethics seems to define mid-level ethical prin -\\nciples, an approach pioneered by biomedical ethics ( Beauchamp & \\nChildress, 2009; The National Commission for the Protection of Human \\nSubjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research. (1979), 1979 ). This \\napproach, sometimes referred to as principlism, is not without criticism \\n( Clouser & Gert, 1990 ). It has the practical advantage of sidestepping \\nlong-standing ethical debates. But it is open to the charge that it fails to \\nsolve practical ethical issues, due to the apparent consensus on ethical \\nprinciples that then fail to guide practical action (B. Mittelstadt, 2019 ). \\nNevertheless, the creation and compilation of ethical principles form key \\naspects of the ethics of AI debate ( Anabo, Elexpuru-Albizuri, & \\nVillard ´on-Gallego, 2019; Asilomar Conference, 2017; Boden et al., \\n2017 ). In addition, most of the high-level interventions into the ethics of \\nAI discussion are principle-based, such as the guidelines produced by the \\nEuropean High Level Expert Group on AI ( HLEG on AI, 2019 ). For our \\npurposes, it is sufficient to understand the prevalence of ethical princi -\\nples in the AI discourse. We agree with Mittelstadt (2019) , however, in \\nseeing the focus on principles as limiting and will return to the question \\nof an appropriate ethical theoretical basis for the ethics of AI below. \\nDiscussions of the ethics of AI tend to cover particular ethical issues. \\nThese are typically particular features of the technology or consequences \\nof its use that the authors see as problematic. Many of these have long- \\nstanding histories in ethics of technology or ethics of computing, such as \\nsecurity, privacy or access. Some of them seem to be particularly linked \\nto the algorithms that drive AI, such as problems of algorithmic biases \\n( CDEI, 2019 ; K. Johnson, Pasquale, & Chapman, 2019 ; B. D. Mittelstadt \\net al., 2016 ) and many of them are linked to the compilation and \\nmanipulation of large data sets that are required for many of the current \\nAI techniques ( Metcalf et al., 2016; Nerurkar et al., 2016; Taylor, 2016 ). \\nSome ethical issues are specific to particular application areas, such as \\nfinance or autonomous vehicles, whereas others are seen as broadly \\nrelevant to all AI areas. \\n2.3. Purpose of AI and governance proposals \\nThe number and reach of ethical issues linked to AI is enormous, in \\nparticular, when considering the breadth of possible application areas. \\nAddressing them is therefore a challenge that has attracted much \\nattention. One key question that needs to be answered before any \\nmitigation measures can be developed is the role that AI has and is \\nmeant to have in society. AI, along with most other information and \\ncommunications technologies (ICTs), has a particularly high level of \\ninterpretive flexibility ( Doherty, Coombs, & Loan-Clarke, 2006 ), which \\nmeans that it is difficult to predict how it will be used. This has been a \\nkey driver for thinking about ethical aspects of ICTs for decades, \\nsometimes discussed under the heading of “ logical malleability ” ( Moor, \\n1985 ). What this means is that even in cases where a technology is \\ndesigned for a particular purpose, it is difficult to foresee whether and to \\nwhat degree it will be used for this purpose. \\nWe distinguish between different purposes of making use of AI. The \\nfirst and most prominent purpose is to improve processes and efficiency. \\nFor organisations using AI, this translates into lower costs, higher pro -\\nductivity and, eventually, higher profits. The second purpose is the use \\nfor social control. AI techniques are the enablers for voice and face \\nrecognition and can therefore be used for surveillance and tracking in -\\ndividuals. This is the basis for controlling individuals to ensure they \\nfollow specific requirements. This is the underlying idea of the Chinese \\nSocial Credit System ( Liu, 2019 ). The third purpose of using AI is to \\npromote human flourishing. Flourishing is an ethical principle typically \\nassociated with virtue ethics, which has a well-established history of \\napplication to digital technologies (T. W. Bynum, 2006 ) and which has \\nbeen used to frame the AI debate more recently ( ALLEA & Royal Society, \\n2019 ). It is not always trivial to determine what constitutes flourishing \\nor how technology can contribute to it. However, any attempts to use ‘AI \\nfor Good ’ , as the title of the series of summits organised by the Inter -\\nnational Telecommunication Union suggests ( https://aiforgood.itu.int/ \\n), can count in this category. \\nWe realise that this is a strong simplification and that these in -\\ntentions and purposes of AI are not necessarily mutually exclusive and \\ndo not comprehensively cover all possibilities. The need for contact \\ntracing to fight a pandemic, for example, shows that social control can \\nbe conducive to human flourishing. Similarly, the optimisation of pro -\\ncesses and resulting profit maximisation leads to higher income and \\nwelfare, which can (but do not have to) contribute to broader human \\nflourishing. The Venn diagram in Fig. 1 indicates that the three different \\npurposes can intersect and overlap. However, they are recognisably \\ndifferent ways of approaching AI and have different ethical implications \\nand connotations. \\nIntentions behind promoting AI are important to understand and \\nevaluate perceptions of ethics and possible governance mechanisms \\nemployed to address ethical issues. These intentions do not develop in \\nisolation but form part of a larger socio-economic, cultural and political \\ncontext that influences the way a ‘good society ’ is perceived and the role \\nAI can play in it ( Cath, Wachter, Mittelstadt, Taddeo, & Floridi, 2016 ). \\nWe do not wish to overstate differences between regions or underesti -\\nmate levels of disagreement within political cultures, but we think it is \\nprobably safe to say that the European approach to AI aims to promote \\nhuman flourishing, even where this may lead to trade-offs with effi -\\nciency or access, which may result from specific interventions, such as \\nthe EU ’ s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) ( General Data \\nProtection Regulation, 2016 ; see also Kaplan & Haenlein, 2019 ). \\nIn order to assess whether a response to an ethical issue is appro -\\npriate or likely to be successful, we need to not only understand the \\npurpose of AI, but also the range of possible options used to address the \\nissue. This paper does not offer the space to review all governance ar -\\nrangements or tools that are available to implement them (see Hagen -\\ndorff, 2019; Morley, Floridi, Kinsey, & Elhalal, 2019 ). For the purposes \\nof this paper, we seek to understand the types and levels of activity that \\naim to provide governance mechanisms for AI. Below, we distinguish \\nbetween measures aimed at the individual, the organisation and society. \\nFig. 1. Possible purposes of AI.  \\nB.C.

Individual researchers and de -\\nvelopers can make use of a quickly growing number of AI ethics \\nframeworks originating from companies, governments or other organi -\\nsations. The EU ’ s High Level Expert Group is a pertinent example ( HLEG \\non AI, 2019 ) but many others exist. Individual developers can make use \\nof professional guidance, for example, from bodies such as the ACM or \\nBCS ( Brinkman et al., 2017 ). Standardisation initiatives, such as the \\nISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 42 - Artificial intelligence or the IEEE P7000 family of \\nstandards, consider the ethics of AI and, once agreed, can provide \\nguidance. Development methodologies can be created or adapted to pay \\nattention to ethical issues, for example, by integrating specific issues \\ninto the design process, such as privacy by design ( Cavoukian, 2017; \\nHansen, 2016; Information Commissioner ’ s Office, 2008 ) or more \\nbroadly by adopting an ethics by design stance ( Beard & Longstaff, \\n2018; Iphofen & Kritikos, 2019; Martin & Makoundou, 2017 ). \\nThe second level of measures provides guidance for organisations to \\nfollow or adopt. According to Clarke ( Clarke, 2019b, 2019a ), established \\nmechanisms of risk management can go a long way in allowing orga -\\nnisations to address the ethics of AI. Organisations can employ existing \\nimpact assessment approaches such as privacy (or data protection) \\nimpact assessments ( CNIL, 2015 ), technology assessment ( Grunwald, \\n2009 ), ethics impact assessment ( Wright, 2011 ), social impact assess -\\nment ( Becker & Vanclay, 2003 ) or human rights impact assessment \\n( Latonero, 2018 ). They can extend existing governance mechanisms, \\nsuch as those used for quality assurance or data governance ( British \\nAcademy & Royal Society, 2017; Khatri & Brown, 2010; OECD, 2017 ), \\nand ensure these cover AI. Similarly, many organisations have estab -\\nlished mechanisms for dealing with ethical and broader societal con -\\ncerns, often discussed under the heading of corporate social \\nresponsibility (CSR) ( Garriga & Mel ´e, 2004 ), which can be extended to \\ninclude AI and emerging technologies. \\nThe final level is the societal and policy level, covering national and \\ninternational policy and regulation. These drive a lot of individual and \\norganisational activity and therefore play a role in governing AI. It is, \\ntherefore, not surprising that policy and regulatory mechanisms play a \\nprominent role concerning the ethics of AI. There are existing statutory \\ninstruments, such as the GDPR ( General Data Protection Regulation, \\n2016 ), that clearly address some of the issues that AI raises. Similarly, \\nthere are principles of human rights, that are addressed and safeguarded \\nin international agreements, such as the Universal Declaration of Human \\nRights or the European Convention on Human Rights, that cover rele -\\nvant rights such as the right not to be discriminated against that have \\nrelevant applications to AI. Similarly, legislation in areas such as \\ncompetition law, product liability or intellectual property can have \\nconsequences for AI. One type of regulatory instrument with regard to AI \\nis the creation of a regulator to oversee AI development and use. This can \\nbe achieved by extending the remit of existing regulators, such as data \\nprotection authorities, or by creating new bodies. \\nOn all three of these levels, the individual, the organisational and the \\nnational / international, there can be different focus areas. AI can be \\nlooked at in general terms or specific application areas can be \\nemphasised, such as AI in health, finance, politics, public services or \\nFig. 2.

In many cases, organisational or technical tools may exist or \\ncould be developed to support governance structures. \\nThe aim of this very brief overview of ethics and governance of AI, \\ngraphically represented in Fig. 2 (above), was to demonstrate the \\ncomplexity of the topic area. The discourse of ethics and AI is currently \\ncharacterised by a cacophony of voices and contributions. There is no \\nlack of ideas or proposals. The challenge is to synthesise a manageable \\napproach from the multitude of activities. This synthesis should start \\nwith a useful and manageable categorisation of ethical issues that lends \\nitself to an analysis of suitable governance structures that can be applied \\nto these issues. This paper attempts such a synthesis based on a multi- \\ndimensional research approach, as described in the next section. \\n3. Methodology: A multi-dimensional approach \\nWhile there is a large and quickly growing literature on ethical issues \\nof AI, much of it is anecdotal or speculative. In our research, we there -\\nfore aimed to combine academic rigour with detailed insights into the \\nway in which AI is realised in society and a broad and conceptual \\noverview of the field. No one single established methodology can ach -\\nieve this. We therefore decided to use a multi-dimensional approach that \\ninvolved using and combining several methods to collect and interpret \\ndata and develop an understanding of the field of ethics and AI. \\nThe geographical focus of our study is Europe. We wanted to know \\nwhether the influence of AI on human flourishing is noticeable in the \\nway AI is developed and deployed. In order to understand this, to gain an \\nin-depth understanding of the social reality of AI across different \\napplication domains at present and in the future and to understand the \\ntechnical, ethical and human rights implications, we undertook a multi- \\ndimensional study comprising the following: \\n1 10 interpretive case studies of AI application in particular applica -\\ntion domains and organisations  \\n2 Five policy-oriented scenarios exploring near term ( < 5 years) use of \\nemerging AI applications  \\n3 An ethical impact analysis of AI  \\n4 A human rights analysis of AI  \\n5 A technical analysis of threats and vulnerabilities connected with AI. \\nThe following figure is a graphical representation of the research \\napproach (See Fig. 3 ). \\nA single paper such as this one cannot hope to do justice to the \\ncomplexity of five different major components of a complex multi- \\ndimensional study as presented here. Each of these has been described \\nin detail elsewhere ( Andreou et al., 2019; Macnish, Ryan, Gregory, et al., \\n2019; Macnish & Ryan, 2019; Patel, Hatzakis, Macnish, Ryan, & Kir -\\nichenko, 2019; Wright et al., 2019 ). Instead of a detailed account of all \\nmethodological considerations, we focus here on a brief overview of the \\ndifferent methods and why they provided the insights we required for \\nour research objective. \\nThe motivation for undertaking a set of case studies arose from the \\nlack of rigorous empirical academic research of AI across application \\nareas. While there are numerous studies of the impact of AI in particular \\nareas, a broader understanding of AI required a set of comparable in -\\nsights in different settings. We chose to undertake a set of interpretive \\ncase studies ( Walsham, 1995 ) because they allowed us to develop a \\ndetailed understanding based on the views of individuals and organi -\\nsations involved. There are certainly many more application areas than \\n10, but undertaking 10 studies and doing a comparative analysis ( Yin, \\n2003 ) gave us the confidence of being able to develop a strong under -\\nstanding across applications. We developed a case study protocol and \\npilot tested it during the summer of 2018. The empirical work was un -\\ndertaken in 2018 and 2019. We interviewed a total of 22 stakeholders \\nacross the 10 case studies. For each case, we furthermore undertook \\nbackground research on the organisation in question as well as the field \\nin which the case study was undertaken (e.g., AI in finance, agriculture). \\nThe analysis was undertaken collaboratively using NVivo Server 11. The \\npartners wrote up case studies following an agreed template, cross- \\nreviewed and published on our website ( Macnish, Ryan, & Stahl, \\n2019 ). All case studies were furthermore developed as stand-alone \\npublications whose references are listed in Table 1 . \\nIn order to broaden our understanding further, but also to go beyond \\nthe description of current technologies, we decided to develop a set of \\nfive scenarios. The social domain in which AI is employed was discussed \\nsimultaneously for case studies and scenarios (see table below). This \\nserved to broaden the range of insights. \\nThe scenarios were constructed with a specific focus on providing \\napplicable insights that could help decision-makers, notably those \\nworking in policy development, to develop and implement governance \\nmechanisms. Based on the rich history of scenario methods ( Andersen & \\nFig. 3. Components of the multi-dimensional research approach underpinning this research.  \\nB.C.

At its core, a policy scenario aims at a rela -\\ntively short time horizon that is of relevance to policymakers caught up \\nin election cycles. We aimed to develop scenarios that are relevant in \\nseveral years. A second important aspect of policy scenarios is close \\nstakeholder engagement. For each scenario, we organised a face-to-face \\nworkshop that included stakeholders and involved them in the revision \\nand refinement of the scenarios. All scenarios were peer reviewed and \\nmade publicly available in June 2019 ( Macnish, Wright, & Jiya, 2020; \\nWright et al., 2019 ). \\nWhile the work on case studies and scenarios gave us the confidence \\nto be in a position to understand a broad range of ethical aspects of AI in \\nsocial situations, this knowledge had to be based on and complemented \\nby current academic and other debates about ethical issues and human \\nrights implications. We furthermore realised that it was important to \\nunderstand the technical aspects of AI, notably questions of security and \\nvulnerabilities of AI systems that have potentially large implications for \\nthe use and social impact of these technologies. \\nThe ethical and human rights analyses were undertaken as desk \\nresearch drawing on appropriate sources of their various disciplines (i. \\ne., philosophy and human rights law). We also conducted a study of \\nsecurity issues, dangers, and implications of the use of data analytics and \\nartificial intelligence. We examined:  \\n• ways in which machine-learning systems are commonly mis- \\nimplemented or mis-used (and recommendations on how to pre -\\nvent this from happening);  \\n• ways in which machine-learning models and algorithms can be \\nattacked (and mitigations against such attacks);  \\n• how artificial intelligence and data analysis methodologies and \\ntechnologies might be used for malicious purposes. \\nThis initial review of security-related issues and possible sources of \\nharm provided the starting point for further and ongoing studies of \\nspecific vulnerabilities of AI. The purpose of this task was to provide a \\nbaseline understanding of the current capabilities and applications of \\nmachine learning, including examples of potential malicious uses of \\nmachine learning techniques, and the implications of attacks against \\nsystems powered by machine learning. \\n4. Findings and Discussion \\nThe purpose of this paper is to contribute to the discussion about how \\nto identify, interpret and address ethical issues arising from AI appli -\\ncations. In order to achieve this, we need a comprehensive overview of \\nboth conceptual and empirical insights into AI and its use. We therefore \\ndraw on a range of research activities outlined below. The underlying \\nempirical studies were not re-analysed but taken as the starting point for \\ncompiling and, more importantly, for categorising these issues. The \\nimportant contribution to the AI ethics discourse that this paper makes is \\nin the conceptualisation and proposed narrative which is based on the \\noverall findings. It is therefore only possible to provide a high-level \\noverview of the empirical work, all of which is published elsewhere. \\nOur research showed that the breadth of ethical issues discussed in \\nthe literature is reflected to a large extent in organisational practice. A \\ncross-case analysis extracting the moral issues that were raised in the \\ndifferent case studies showed a large number of ethical issues, many of \\nthem recurring, as shown in the following table (See Table 2 ). \\nThis table listing the ethical issues we encountered is the result of our \\ndata analysis and represents our interpretation and categorisation of \\nwhat respondents shared with us. The terms used to denote the indi -\\nvidual ethical issues were discussed and agreed during the data analysis. \\nThe results of the analysis from the case studies were supported by the \\nfirst round of our Delphi Study, which targeted experts in AI and big data \\n( Santiago, 2020 ). Implemented as an online survey, the first set of \\nquestions was e-mailed to 231 experts, 50 per cent of whom were \\nwomen. We received 145 responses.Following review of the data and \\ndata cleansing, 41 responses contained sufficient information to warrant \\nanalysis. The first (open-ended) question covered the same ground, \\nasking “ What do you think are the three most important ethical or \\nhuman rights issues raised by AI and / or big data? ” Fig. 4 shows the \\nmost frequently given answers: \\nOne important insight from our empirical work was that the many \\nethical issues discussed in the literature are reflected in practice. Some \\nissues are almost ubiquitous, such as those related to privacy and data \\nprotection. This paper does not offer a detailed analysis of the issues, nor \\nof the exact differences between the case study and Delphi study find -\\nings. One key point from our findings is that clearly recognisable issues \\nare well covered are roughly consistent. The Delphi study is under -\\nstandably broader than the case studies that focused on organisational \\npractice, including issues such as ’ awakening ’ of AI that do not play a \\nrole in current implementations of AI. Our conceptual review of the \\nethics of AI and the analysis of our empirical work agreed to a large \\nextent, showing that the literature covers the same issues of individuals \\nand organisations working with AI (See Fig. 4 ). \\nHowever, while it was possible to analyse our data using widely \\naccepted terms, we note that the local meaning of these terms varied \\nwidely. The meaning of the term privacy, for example, in a medical \\ndiagnostic context, in the use of social media for logistics prediction or in \\nthe case of agricultural optimisation, differs greatly. Privacy is “ an \\ninherently heterogenous, fluid and multidimensional concept ” ( Finn, \\nWright, & Friedewald, 2013, p. 26 ) and can be divided up into a number \\nof sub-types ( Koops et al., 2017; Solove, 2002 ). In general, privacy in the \\nAI ethics discourse seems to refer to data privacy or information privacy \\nwhich touches on various other types of privacy (ibid). Other theoretical \\npositions on privacy ( Tavani, 2008 ) are not widely employed in the AI \\ndiscourse. While this connection is rarely made explicit, there is an \\nunderlying assumption that implementing data protection mechanisms \\nis the way to ensure privacy, although this has been contested ( Macnish, \\n2020 ). This position is reflected in our findings where the frequent \\nreferences to privacy as an issue were accompanied by a strong emphasis \\non often technical data protection measures. However, it is important to \\nnote that privacy risks take very different forms in these contexts, \\nrequiring different technical and organisational measures to ensure \\ncompliance with data protection legislation, but also to ensure that \\nbroader ethical issues are covered. \\nInterestingly, our analysis of human rights concerns, undertaken in \\nparallel with the case studies, found that the human rights issues that \\ncan be found in the literature are closely related to and overlap with the \\nTable 1 \\nSocial domains of case studies and scenarios (CS: = Case Study; SC: = Scenario).  \\nNo. Social Domain of Case Study / \\nScenario \\nReference \\nCS01 Employee monitoring and \\nadministration \\n( Antoniou & Andreou, 2019 ) \\nCS02 Government ( Ryan, 2019a ) \\nCS03 Agriculture ( Ryan, 2019b ) \\nCS04 Sustainable development ( Ryan & Gregory, 2019 ) \\nCS05 Science ( Jiya, 2019b ) \\nCS06 Insurance ( Kancevi ˇcien ˙e, 2019 ) \\nCS07 Energy and utilities ( Hatzakis, Rodrigues, & Wright, 2019 ) \\nCS08 Communications, media and \\ncybersecurity \\n( Macnish, Inguanzo, & Kirichenko, \\n2019 ) \\nCS09 Retail and wholesale trade ( Macnish & Inguanzo, 2019 ) \\nCS10 Manufacturing and natural \\nresources \\n( Jiya, 2019a ) \\nSC01 Social care All scenarios are described in detail in ( \\nWright et al., 2019 ) SC02 Information warfare \\nSC03 Education \\nSC04 Transportation \\nSC05 Predictive policing  \\nB.C.

Human rights declarations such as the Universal Declaration \\nare political statements, but they have long found their way into positive \\nlaw. Europe, for example, has the European Convention on Human \\nRights (ECHR) at the international level, which originates from the \\nCouncil of Europe but is authoritative in the EU legal order. The EU has \\nits own legally binding human rights instrument, the EU Charter of \\nFundamental Rights (EUCFR), whose scope can be said to be wider and \\ndeeper than the ECHR, as evidenced in the table below. This is relevant \\nbecause it means that many of the ethical issues identified by our \\nresearch are not just ethical issues, but, where they relate to human \\nrights questions, may well be open to adjudication in a court of law. The \\nfollowing overview of human rights that may be affected by AI is \\ntherefore interesting, as it shows where and how these human rights are \\nenshrined in existing human rights instruments, namely the ECHR and \\nthe EUCFR (See Table 3 ). \\nAll of these rights and freedoms were raised as a concern in at least \\none of our case studies or scenarios, thus further demonstrating the \\nbroad range of concerns. The reason for including this table in the text \\nwas that for readers not familiar with the detail of our case studies, it \\nshows a list of human rights that are easy to associate with AI use and \\ndemonstrates that there are legal instruments that could deal with these. \\nAs several overlaps were identified in terms of, for example, relevant \\nlegal instruments and types of solution proposed, these were intertwined \\nin the establishment of a ‘blueprint ’ of current and future practice in \\nrelation to the interrelationship of human rights, law, ethics and smart \\ninformation systems, those systems that have AI and big data analytics at \\ntheir core ( Stahl & Wright, 2018 ). \\nHuman rights touch on or are directly part of many of the issues \\nrelated to AI. Our analysis shows the breadth of human rights concerns \\nusing the European human rights framework. It seems plausible that a \\nmore direct application of human rights legislation to AI can provide \\nsome clarity on related issues and point the way to possible solutions. It \\nis therefore not surprising that there are many voices that point to the \\napplication of human rights to AI as a key way of addressing these issues \\n( Access Now Policy Team, 2018; BSR, 2018; Committee on Bioethics \\n(DH-BIO), 2019; Council of Europe, 2019; Latonero, 2018; World Eco -\\nnomic Forum, 2019 ). \\n4.1. Classification of ethical issues \\nThis paper has so far confirmed that there are many potential ethical \\nissues related to AI. We have furthermore shown that there are \\nnumerous governance approaches, including human rights legislation, \\nthat can address many of these issues. An ongoing problem, however, is \\nthe complexity of the landscape, the fact that there are too many ethical \\nissues and ways of addressing them to allow scholars or practitioners to \\nkeep an overview. \\nFig. 6.

We propose three types of \\nissues that have significant specificities to allow them to be clustered: \\nspecific issues of machine learning, general questions about living in a \\ndigital world and metaphysical questions. \\n4.1.1. Specific issues of machine learning \\nMachine learning and the various techniques used to achieve it have \\nsome characteristics at the core of particular ethical issues. Two of these \\ncharacteristics seem most likely to raise ethical issues: First, many of the \\ncurrent machine-learning techniques are opaque, which means that \\neven experts with relevant equipment cannot determine why and how \\ninputs are transformed into outputs, e.g. how exactly a personal profile \\nleads to a classification in terms of a mortgage application or parole \\ndecision. Second, these systems require access to big amounts of data for \\ntraining and validation purposes. \\nResulting ethical issues are, for example, those having to do with bias \\nand discrimination (Johnson et al., 2019; Macnish, 2012), which can \\narise on the basis of undetected biases included in the training data. \\nFurther specific issues are linked to the use of data, which may be per -\\nsonal data and which may allow additional insights into individual \\npersonal behaviour through AI and big data analysis. Questions around \\nprivacy and data protection therefore arise on this level as do concerns \\nabout security and integrity of systems, algorithms and data (Stahl & \\nWright, 2018). \\nThese issues are common to most specific applications of AI. Algo -\\nrithmic biases, discrimination, security and transparency are issues that \\nare directly linked to the characteristics of machine learning. Others, \\nsuch as quality and accuracy of data are closely related. Our case study \\nanalysis suggests that these issues are prominent among the AI users in \\norganisations. They materialise and present themselves in specific and \\ncontext-dependent ways. From the perspective of this paper, an inter -\\nesting feature is that these issues can become visible and are – at least to \\nsome degree – capable of being addressed on the project or organisa -\\ntional level. While these ethical issues represent some of those most \\nfrequently mentioned in our empirical research, it is important to see \\nthat many of the ethical issues do not seem to be linked to the technical \\nproperties of AI as machine learning but point to the broader socio- \\neconomic context in which these technologies are used. \\n4.1.2. General questions about living in a digital world \\nOur second category of ethical issues includes those that have less to \\ndo with the specific capabilities of AI and more with the way societies \\nuse technologies many of which incorporate elements of machine \\nlearning or other AI techniques. These issues play to a general feeling of \\nunease with the way in which industrialised societies develop and the \\nrole that technology plays in promoting certain developments and \\ninhibiting others. These issues are currently discussed in the context of \\nAI because the expectation is that AI will greatly influence them, but \\nthey are better understood as questions that relate to how modern so -\\ncieties organise themselves using technologies such as AI. A key char -\\nacteristic of these technologies seems to be autonomy, i.e., the ability to \\nact without direct human input. This, combined with higher levels \\nability to detect patterns and act accordingly, can lead to the replace -\\nment of humans by machines. Another key feature of digital technolo -\\ngies with high ethical relevance is that they increasingly constitute the \\nenvironment in which humans live. The malleability of digital tech -\\nnologies means that our realities can easily be changed. Maybe even \\nmore importantly, the constitutive element of digital technologies in \\nmodern social reality means that the owners and controllers of these \\ntechnologies become immensely powerful in many different ways. \\nKey examples of these issues are the influence of technology on \\neconomic and political power, the future of warfare or distribution of \\ncosts and benefits of AI. The high-profile example of the misuse of social \\nmedia data for purposes of the manipulation of democratic elections in \\nthe case of Cambridge Analytica (Isaak & Hanna, 2018) is the most \\nvisible case in point. But while Cambridge Analytica represents a rela -\\ntively clear-cut case of misuse of AI and big data, there are broader \\nquestions about the economic and resulting political power amassed by \\nthe tech industry (Macnish & Galliott, 2020). The market capitalisation \\nand therefore economic power of the big tech companies is now such \\nthat many observers are increasingly worried about the mere possibility \\nof oversight of these actors. One resulting question is that of justice of \\ndistribution of costs and benefits. Big tech companies have the technical \\ninfrastructure and know-how to create ever-larger data sets and benefit \\nfrom these whereas smaller competitors lack the means to catch up. The \\nrole of consumers and end users at present is predominantly passive; \\nthey produce data and consume services, but have little control over the \\nuse of their data. \\nOther larger-scale societal concerns have to do with the question \\nabout what technology can and should do. A high-profile example of this \\nis the use of AI-driven autonomous weaponry that has the potential to \\nchange the face of modern warfare (Defense Innovation Board, 2019; \\nSparrow, 2009). But there are many other examples where it is not clear- \\ncut what machines can and should do, e.g., with regard to autonomous \\nvehicles or care robots (Decker, 2008; Sharkey & Sharkey, 2010; Bernd \\nCarsten Stahl & Coeckelbergh, 2016). \\nOur empirical findings support the relevance of these issues. In fact, \\nand somewhat surprisingly, ethical issues in this category constitute the \\nmajority of issues. Economic consequences, employment, fairness, \\nfreedom, the ability of having human contact, individual autonomy, \\ninequality, integrity, justice, ownership, military use, power asymmetry, \\nresponsibility and sustainability all fall into the category. \\n4.1.3. Metaphysical questions \\nThe final set of questions concerns what machines should be allowed \\nto do and points to some of the deeper philosophical and metaphysical \\nquestions about the future of AI and autonomous machines and their \\nrelationship with humans. There has been a long-standing discussion \\nabout the change of human nature due to machines, the emergence of \\ncyborgs (Latimer, 2017) and transhumans (Livingstone, 2015). In par -\\nallel, there has been discussion whether machines can ever become \\nsentient or conscious (Carter et al., 2018; Dehaene, Lau, & Kouider, \\n2017), whether there will be a singularity (Kurzweil, 2006) at which \\npoint machines will develop superintelligence (Bostrom, 2016). \\nThese developments are controversially discussed and highly \\ncontentious. They are based on the idea of general AI (Baum, 2017). In \\nthis paper, we do not take a position on whether these developments are \\nlikely or even possible. We also refrain from taking a position on \\nwhether current narrow AI can lead to general AI or whether a funda -\\nmentally different approach would be needed. In our case studies, we \\nfound no evidence of their being considered a current priority, but in our \\nscenarios, there are examples of technologies that come close to this \\ncategory. In the Delphi study, there was reference to ’awakening of AI’, \\nwhich falls into this category. The reason for including them here is thus \\nless their current practical relevance and more the fact that they are \\nprominent and highly visible in science fiction, the media and increas -\\ningly in policy discussions – which, of course, in no way reduces the \\nlegitimacy of the concerns they raise. \\nThe following figure aims to summarise these three types of ethical \\nissues of AI (See Fig. 7). \\nThe classification suggested in the above figure serves as a starting \\npoint to explore how governance structures are positioned to address \\nethical issues. \\n4.2. Governing the three types of issues \\nThe purpose of classifying ethical issues in the previous section was \\nto render the broad array of ethical issues more manageable and impose \\nsome order on the chaos of AI ethics. In this section, we now look at how \\nthis can help identify suitable governance structures. Before we start \\nB.C.

We hope that the distinction makes sense \\nand is plausible, but we are happy to concede that it is not exclusive. \\nPrivacy, to take an example, materialises on the local and project level, \\nbut is seen as a societal question ( Roessler & Mokrosinska, 2015 ), sub -\\nject to legislation and regulation and arguably based on human needs \\narising from human nature ( Locke, 2010 ). With this contingent nature of \\nthe classification in mind, we now look at how this translates to \\ngovernance mechanisms. \\nIn our discussion of governance, we take the position that the \\ndesirable purpose of AI should be to support human flourishing. As \\ndiscussed earlier, this does not preclude uses of AI for efficiency max -\\nimisation or control but implies that the overall aim of development and \\ndeployment of the technology should be to improve human lives. This \\nposition has the disadvantage of muddying the waters, raising difficult \\nquestions of what counts as flourishing and who determines this. It is \\nalso likely to require the balancing of competing goods, values and in -\\nterests. But it is arguably the purpose of AI research, development, \\nfunding and application on which most citizens in democratic states, and \\nmaybe most human beings, can agree. It is also aligned with the EU ’ s AI \\npolicies. Based on an agreement that AI is to support human flourishing, \\nthe question then is how ethical issues can be addressed and which \\ngovernance structures can help us deal with them. \\nTo return to the suggested classification of ethical issues ( Fig. 6 ) and \\ncompare this with the earlier description of governance proposals \\n( Fig. 2 ), it is easy to see that there is no simple and/or linear relation -\\nship. The two sets of classification do not align, but can be better un -\\nderstood as a matrix, where all levels of governance (individual, \\norganisational, policy) can refer to all types of ethical issues (specific \\nissues, general questions, metaphysical questions). \\nIn many cases, the issues that we classified as specific arising from \\nmachine learning appear easiest to address. They can be subject to the \\napplication of existing governance mechanisms. Data protection or se -\\ncurity issues provide a good example. Data protection is furthermore \\ngoverned by legislation and regulation, even though the details of these \\nlegislative requirements differ significantly between jurisdictions. Not \\nonly is there ample regulation, there are also structures such as data \\nprotection impact assessments ( CNIL, 2017a, 2017b ) or standards such \\nas the ISO 27000 family that allow structured approaches. Similar ob -\\nservations apply to other examples of the specific issues arising from \\nmachine learning, such as algorithmic biases and subsequent discrimi -\\nnation. Unlike data protection, these are less comprehensively defined \\nand regulated. A key problem here is that it may be difficult to under -\\nstand what exactly the issue is. There are several high-profile examples \\nof these problems, e.g., where a system evaluating job applications leads \\nto discrimination on the basis of gender or where predictive policing or \\nparole decisions lead to discrimination on the basis of race. There is \\nbroad consensus that discrimination on the basis of gender or race is \\nimmoral and to be avoided. However, it is not clear whether other \\nsystems discriminate on the basis of other properties that are less high- \\nprofile and of which individuals are unaware. It is conceivable that a \\nmedical diagnostic system might lead to discrimination on the basis of \\nblood type or a dating system would prefer individuals on the basis of \\ntheir height. This raises questions about how we would even know how \\nto check for relevant characteristics and, even if confirmed, whether and \\nwhy this would constitute an ethical issue. \\nThese issues can be described in terms of transparency and \\nexplainability. At the heart of the problem is the fact that humans expect \\nexplanations that they can understand, whereas machine learning \\nFig. 7. Classification of ethical issues of AI.  \\nB.C.

The prominence of transparency as a perceived \\nissue may explain why the same term is used to denote an ethical \\nprinciple that pervades the AI ethics guidelines (Jobin, Ienca, & Vayena, \\n2019). The ethical principle of transparency is described as a way to \\nminimise harm, improve AI, foster trust and improve AI (ibid). It is also \\nlinked to dialogue, participation and democracy. Elsewhere we have \\ntried to unpack the normative implications of ethical principles, \\nincluding the principle of transparency (Ryan & Stahl, 2020). Of course, \\nwhile transparency may be perceived as obligatory, it does not in itself \\nresolve the ethical or privacy risks at issue. Transparency only gets us \\npart of the way to solutions. \\nThe example of transparency indicates that the ethical issues arising \\nfrom AI are not clearly defined. The perception that something consti -\\ntutes an ethical issue does not by itself clarify whether this perception is \\naccurate or on which grounds such an evaluation would be possible. It \\nsays little about the exact nature of the issue and its status from a \\ntheoretical ethical perspective. \\nIn the case of transparency, there is now a quickly growing research \\ncommunity that focuses on such questions of transparency and \\nexplainability of AI (USACM, 2017). While these questions remain open, \\nthere is at least reason to hope that they can be addressed on the local \\nlevel by designing, testing and reviewing systems using appropriate \\nmethods, relying on professional expertise of developers and users and \\norganisational capacity to develop the relevant expertise. The ISO is \\ndeveloping guidance for developers (e.g., TR 24368). Discussion within \\nISO has recognised that AI is not neutral, that values embedded in al -\\ngorithms are intentionally or inadvertently shaped by the pro -\\ngrammers’, operators’, and third-parties’ own worldviews and cognitive \\nbiases and that ethical violations could also result from AI deployed or \\ndeveloped prematurely, applied without proper consideration of the \\nways it could negatively impact individuals or society. \\nThe second set of issues, those relating to general questions about \\nliving in a digital world, are not capable of being dealt with on the micro \\nor meso level of the individual or organisation. This does not mean that \\nthere are no existing governance mechanisms that could be applied to \\nAI. Nation states can make use of policy, legislative and regulatory op -\\ntions and this is happening at large scale with regard to AI. At the same \\ntime, there are many existing structures that may well be suited to \\ndealing with at least some of the challenges related to AI, even if such \\nstructures can be criticised as having failed to deal adequately with the \\nethical, privacy and societal issues. Consumer protection legislation, \\ncompetition law, anti-trust law, data protection law as well as human \\nrights legislation may well be capable of regulating AI and its conse -\\nquences, at least in part. Similarly, existing regulators may make a claim \\nthat they can address the challenges of AI. This suggests a close affinity \\nbetween this type of ethical issue and the policy level of governance \\noptions. The key to the resolution of these issues does indeed seem to be \\non a policy level, as they touch on constitutive questions of modern \\nsocieties (e.g., who can own what, how do we distribute wealth and \\nrisks, the asymmetries in the power wielded by the big tech companies \\nthrough their algorithms). Ethical issues of AI may be subject to existing \\nregulation, but it is entirely possible that additional regulation and \\nlegislation will be required to facilitate human flourishing. Nevertheless, \\nthe policy level needs to be supplemented by actions on the organisa -\\ntional and individual levels. \\nThe most difficult area to govern is the metaphysical. Questions of \\ngeneral AI and its consequences are partly technical and empirical in \\nterms of what technology can achieve in the hands of the big tech \\ncompanies, intelligence agencies and cyber attackers (for example). \\nThey are also partly philosophical insofar as they refer to basic concepts \\nand arguments. To some extent, e.g., where transhumanism displays \\nreligious characteristics [overcoming the body, the distinction between \\n(mortal) body and (immortal) essence of the human], they may be most \\nsuitably dealt with by theology. While it may be difficult to deal these \\nissues, they did not receive much attention in our empirical findings. But \\nthat does not mean that proactive attention to these issues would be \\nmisplaced or that it might not be advisable to think about early warning \\nsigns or trigger points where more attention should be paid to such \\nissues. \\nInsights from our case studies suggest that this way of looking at \\nethical issues and governance clarifies current activities. This paper does \\nnot provide the space for a comprehensive analysis, so suffice it to say \\nthat the organisations in our case studies focused on the issues arising \\nfrom machine learning and on established and practical ways of \\naddressing them. The dominant topics were security and data protec -\\ntion, which companies dealt with in ways to ensure they met their legal \\nresponsibilities. They focused on technical approaches to achieve these. \\nIn addition, companies developed oversight mechanisms and reflective \\ncapabilities, e.g., by instituting ethics boards or engaging with stake -\\nholders. Respondents were aware of the policy issues but not actively \\nengaged with them. Similarly, as noted, the metaphysical issues did not \\nplay a role in the social reality of the case studies. \\nOne interesting point to observe is that in our case study research, \\nthere was little reference even to most of the governance mechanisms \\nthat we categorised as aimed at the organisational level. Activities like \\nrisk management, impact assessments or human rights integration into \\ncompany policies were not mentioned by our respondents. This does not \\nmean that the companies did not engage in them or that they were \\nunsuccessful, but that in the responses to our questions, the respondents \\ndid not associate them with ethics of AI or big data. It will therefore be \\nimportant for future studies to evaluate the effectiveness of these \\ngovernance approaches. \\n5. Conclusion \\nIn this paper, we have reported some findings and their implications \\nfrom a multi-dimensional research study into the ethics of AI. Our \\nstarting point was the highly complex and often overwhelming AI ethics \\ndiscourse that motivated our attempt to bring better empirical insights \\nbut also conceptual clarity to the discussion. \\nOne outcome of this work was the classification of ethical issues into \\nspecific issues arising from machine learning, general questions about \\nliving in a digital world and metaphysical questions. We hope that this \\nclassification is helpful in identifying issues and finding or developing \\nappropriate governance mechanisms. \\nOur discussion and mapping of existing proposals for AI governance \\nto the three classes of ethical issues give rise to suggestions for further \\nresearch as well as organisational practice. One important observation \\nrefers to the concept of AI and the implications of the use of a particular \\nconcept for subsequent insights. In this study, we started with an in -\\nclusive view of AI that covers not only narrow AI and machine learning, \\nbut also broader socio-technical systems incorporating AI techniques \\nand artificial general intelligence. Our empirical findings show that the \\nfocus of attention in current use of AI is on machine learning and, to \\nsome degree, on broader socio-technical systems. This raises the ques -\\ntion whether it would be desirable to limit the scope of reflection, e.g., \\nby focusing exclusively on machine learning. We suggest that the term \\nAI is broader than machine learning and a rich conceptualisation of AI \\nand its ethical consequences needs to take this into consideration. \\nThis paper has shown that a key next step in the AI ethics discourse \\nneeds to be a more detailed and thorough mapping exercise that not only \\nlists and clearly defines ethical issues but explores to what degree these \\nare novel or manifest inadequate regulatory structures and in need of \\nnovel solutions. As we have suggested above, the broad array of extant \\ngovernance structures may be able to cover many of the issues raised by \\nAI. Whether they do so adequately is another question. Where no rem -\\nedies currently exist, or existing ones are insufficient, further and novel \\nB.C.

The work presented here suggests that \\nthe AI ethics debate can benefit from a different perspective, which we \\nhave offered above. This new perspective is based on a novel catego -\\nrisation of ethical issues that point towards next steps and the bigger \\nquestion about how the different types of issues can be addressed, which \\ncan be used to generate recommendations for organisations. Many \\ncompanies are interested in exploiting the advantages of AI but are \\nunsure about how to deal with societal and ethical issues. Our research \\nshows that there are numerous existing activities, many of which are \\nrelated and interlinked, that will go a long way towards showing that a \\ncompany is serious about engaging with these questions. The integration \\nof CSR structures into organisations in a way that takes into account the \\norganisation ’ s research and development is one such step. An explicit \\ncommitment to human rights and the adoption of processes designed to \\nintegrate human rights into corporate processes would be another such \\nstep. These suggestions are, of course, no guarantees that nothing will go \\nwrong, but they are serious steps in ensuring that the corporate culture \\nsupports human flourishing, through AI and otherwise. \\nA similar conclusion offers itself to policymakers and decision- \\nmakers. Just as companies can look through a portfolio of existing \\ngovernance mechanisms, policymakers should take stock of the ade -\\nquacy of existing policy and regulatory options while developing spe -\\ncific steps to address AI. Some of the issues discussed in the context of AI \\nand the general questions arising in our increasingly digital world have \\nlittle to do with AI in the narrow sense. Questions of justice, distribution \\nand power may be exacerbated by particular technologies but exist in -\\ndependent of them. As a consequence, it may well be that existing \\nlegislation or regulatory bodies are in a good position to deal with at \\nleast some of these questions and the task for policymakers is to ensure \\nthat existing policy and the adequacy of its application are taken into \\naccount in the rush to develop new policy. \\nThe nature of integrating human rights into organisations and the \\ncreation of policy provides another pointer to lessons learned from our \\nwork. The way we deal with the ethics of AI will need to be sensitive to \\nthe conceptually challenging and changing nature of the technologies in \\nquestion and the social perceptions they engender. We should simply not \\nassume that we can provide a permanently stable definition of AI or of \\nthe ethical issues related to it. Instead, we need to embrace a world \\nwhere concepts are changing and contested, where moral preferences \\nchange over time, where scientific, media and political discourses \\ndynamically interact and where impacts of new technologies such as AI \\nneed to be adequately assessed. Ethical positions based on process and \\nexchange, such as discourse ethics ( Mingers & Walsham, 2010; Rehg, \\n2014 ), are well suited to reflect the need for the ongoing negotiations of \\nfacts and values needed to make new technologies work in society. \\nOur work immediately suggests further areas of study. The case \\nstudies, for example, while covering a breadth of activities, could be \\nexpanded to be even more comprehensive. Our approach was open and \\nexploratory. Future empirical work could also test the adequacy of \\nexisting governance mechanisms as well as proposals for new ones, their \\nimpacts and possible side effects (e.g., a loss of social trust in existing \\nmechanisms). A direct mapping of ethical issues and governance pro -\\nposals would be helpful in assessing the effectiveness of the governance \\nproposals, an important factor in developing these further. Further \\nresearch should also be undertaken to broaden the geographical scope of \\nthe study. Our European focus means that we simply took for granted \\ncertain aspects of the AI ecosystem that may not be applicable else -\\nwhere. This includes the strong legal data protection regime of the Eu -\\nropean Union or the existing regulatory, industrial and professional \\nsettings that shape the way in which AI is developed, deployed and used. \\nThe international nature of AI renders necessary such further work. \\nThe high-level view of the AI ethics debate presented in this paper \\nshould make an important contribution to theory and practice. We \\nbelieve that our proposed categorisation is helpful for both scholars and \\npractitioners. It offers a way to navigate the complexities of the AI \\ndebate and helps individuals, organisations and policymakers to find the \\nmost suitable ways of moving on. It also shows that AI ethics is not a \\nproblem to be ‘solved ’ in the sense that there are clear solutions that will \\nmake problems go away. Instead, uncertainties around definitions, \\nethics and values can form the basis for a creative but unpredictable \\njourney towards a desirable future where new technologies including AI \\nare conducive to human flourishing. \\nThis paper provides a clearer, more structured and inclusive narra -\\ntive of ethics of AI. It draws on a set of different research activities to \\ndevelop a way of thinking about AI and ethics that covers the broad \\nrange of technologies that fall under the heading of AI, that covers the \\nmanifold ethical issues associated with AI and that provides a theoretical \\nethical position that can be used to reflect on all of these. It is clear, \\nhowever, that this is only the basis for further work. The difficult \\nquestions about what stakeholders need to do, about which laws and \\nregulations need to be updated or developed, about definitions of pro -\\nfessional or organisational responsibilities etc. still need to be addressed. \\nUndertaking these next steps is important and urgent. It will also be \\ngreatly helped by an empirically based conceptual view of ethics and AI \\nas we offer in this paper. \\nAcknowledgments \\nThis research has received funding from the European Union ’ s Ho -\\nrizon 2020 Framework Programme for Research and Innovation under \\nthe Specific Grant Agreement No. 786641 (SHERPA). \\nReferences \\nAccess Now Policy Team.

Learning: It is the activity of gaining knowledge or skill by studying, practising, being \\ntaught, or experiencing something . Learning enhances the awareness of the subjects \\nof the study.  \\n    The ability of lea rning is possessed by humans, some animals, and AI -enabled   \\nsystems. Learning is categorized as: \\no Auditory Learning: It is learning by listening and hearing. For example, students \\nlistening to recorded audio lectures. \\n \\no Episodic Learning: To learn by remembering sequences of events that one has \\nwitnessed or experienced. This is linear and orderly. \\n \\no Motor Learning: It is learning by precise movement of muscles. For example, \\npicking objects, Writing, etc. \\n \\no Observational Learning: To learn by watching and imitating others. For example, \\nchild tries to learn by mimicking her parent.   \\n \\no Perceptual Learning: It is learning to recognize stimuli that one has seen before. \\nFor example, identifying and classifying objects and situations. \\n \\no Relational Learning: It involves learning to differentiate among various stimuli \\non the basis of relational properties, rather than absolute properties. For Example, \\nAdding ‘little less’ salt at the time of cooking potatoes that came up salty last time, \\nwhen cooked with adding say a tablespoon of salt.  \\n \\no Spatial learning : It is learning through visual stimuli such as images, colors, \\nmaps, etc. For Example,  A person can create roadmap in mind before actually \\nfollowing the road.  \\n \\no Stimulus-Response Learning: It is l earning to perform a part icular behavior \\nwhen a certain stimulus is present . For example, a dog raises its ear on hearing \\ndoorbell.  \\n3. Problem solving: It is the process in which one perceives and tries to arrive at a \\ndesired solution from a present situation by taking some path, wh ich is blocked by \\nknown or unknown hurdles. \\nProblem solving also includes decision making, which is the process of selecting the \\nbest suitable alternative out of multiple alternatives to reach the desired goal are \\navailable.  \\n4.

The following illustration shows a simple ANN: \\n \\nT ypes of Artificial Neural Networks \\nThere are two Artificial Neural Network topologies: FeedForward and Feedback. \\nFeedForward ANN \\nIn this ANN, the information flow is unidirectional.

Each connection has a weight, an integer \\nnumber that controls the signal between the two neurons.  \\nIf the network generates a “good or desired” output, there is no need to adjust the weights. \\nHowever, if the network generates a “poor or undesired” output or an error, then the system \\nalters the weights in order to improve subsequent results. \\nMachine Learning in ANNs \\nANNs are capable of learning  and they need to be trained .

The ANN  makes a \\ndecision by observing its environment . If  the observation is negative, the ne twork \\nadjusts its weights to be able to make a different required decision the next time.  \\nBack Propagation Algorithm \\nIt is the training or learning algorithm.

If you submit to the algorithm \\nthe example of what you want the network to do, it changes the network’s weights so that it \\ncan produce desired output for a particular input on finishing the training.  \\nBack Propagation networks are ideal for simple Pattern Recognition and Mapping Tasks . \\nBayesian Networks (BN) \\nThese are the graphi cal structures used to represent the probabilistic relationship among a \\nset of random variables. Bayesian networks are also called Belief Networks or Bayes Nets. \\nBNs reason about uncertain domain. \\nIn these networks, each node represents a random variable  with specific propositions . For \\nexample, in a medical diagnosis domain, the node Cancer represents the proposition that a \\npatient has cancer.  \\nThe edges connecting the nodes represent probabilistic dependencies among those random \\nvariables. If out of two nodes, one is affecting the other then they must be directly connected \\nin the directions of the effect. The strength of the relationship between variables is quantified \\nby the probability associated with each node. \\nThere is an only constraint on the arcs in a BN that you cannot return to a node simply by \\nfollowing directed arcs. Hence the BNs are called Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). \\nBNs are capable of handling multivalued variables simultaneously. The BN variables are \\ncomposed of two dimensions:  \\n1. Range of prepositions \\n2. Probability assigned to each of the prepositions. \\nConsider a finite set X = {X1, X2, …,Xn} of discrete random variables, where each variable  Xi \\nmay take values from a finite set, denoted by  Val(Xi). If there is a directed link from \\nvariable Xi to variable, Xj, then variable  Xi will be a parent of variable  Xj showing direct \\ndependencies between the variables.  \\nThe structure of BN is ideal for combining prior knowledge and observed data. BN can be used \\nto learn the causal relationships and underst and various problem domains and to predict \\nfuture events, even in case of missing data. \\nBuilding a Bayesian Network \\nA knowledge engineer can build a Bayesian network.

Will there be unseen dangers or consequences? Definitely. That is our pattern with our tools. We invent them, use them to improve our lives and then refine them when we find problems. AI is no different.”  Ashok Goel, director of the human-centered computing Ph.D. program at Georgia Tech, wrote, “Human-AI interaction will be multimodal: We will directly converse with AIs, for example. However, much of the impact of AI will come in enhancing human-human interaction across both space (we will be networked with others) and time (we will have access to all our previously acquired knowledge). This will aid, augment and amplify individual and collective human intelligence in unprecedented and powerful ways.”  David Cake, an leader with Electronic Frontiers Australia and vice-chair of the ICANN GNSO Council, wrote, “In general, machine learning and related technologies have the capacity to greatly reduce human error in many areas where it is'), Document(metadata={'page': 21, 'source': 'pdfs/ai and the future of humans.pdf'}, page_content='can be prone to errors, biases, and false logic or mistaken assumptions. And these experts argue that machine-based decisions often favor “efficiencies” in the name of profit or power that are extremely unfavorable to individuals and the betterment of the human condition. Michael Kleeman, a senior fellow at the University of California, San Diego and board member at the Institute for the Future, wrote, “The utilization of AI will be disproportionate and biased toward those with more resources. In general, it will reduce autonomy, and, coupled with big data, it will reduce privacy and increase social control. There will be some areas where IA [intelligence augmentation] helps make things easier and safer, but by and large it will be a global net negative.” A professor at a major U.S. university and expert in artificial intelligence as applied to social computing said, “As AI systems take in more data and make bigger decisions, people'), Document(metadata={'page': 13, 'source': 'pdfs/ai and the future of humans.pdf'}, page_content='is hard to discern. The relativistic political world will become more so, with people having evidence to support their own reality or multiple realities that mean no one knows what is the ‘truth.’” Thomas Schneider, head of International Relations Service and vice-director at the Federal Office of Communications (OFCOM) in Switzerland, said, “AI will help mankind to be more efficient, live safer and healthier, and manage resources like energy, transport, etc., more efficiently. At the same time, there are a number of risks that AI may be used by those in power to manipulate, control and dominate others. (We have seen this with every new technology: It can and will be used for good and bad.) Much will depend about how AI will be governed: If we have an inclusive and bottom-up governance system of well-informed citizens, then AI will be used for improving our quality of life. If only a few people decide about how AI is used and what for, many others will be dependent on the decisions of'), Document(metadata={'page': 23, 'source': 'pdfs/ai and the future of humans.pdf'}, page_content='makes us human and sensitive to others. My hope is that technology would be used to improve the quality of living, not supplant it. Much of the AI innovation is simply clogging our senses, stealing our time, increasing the channels and invasion of adverts. This has destroyed our phones, filled our mailboxes and crowded our email.
